## HOW MANY DATA ARE MANY DATA?

- BIG DATA IS HARD
- SMALL DATA IS EVERYWHERE
- SMALL DATA FOCUSES ON THE END-USER
- FOR MANY PROBLEMS SMALL DATA IS ENOUGH

THE REAL VALUE IS NOT IN THE LARGE VOLUME OF DATA, BUT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT.

## OVERVIEW

SMALL DATASETS ARE DATASETS THAT FIT INTO RAM MEMORY, LEAVING MEMORY TO SPARE
FOR MANIPULATION AND TRANSFORMATIONS.

USUALLY 2-4 GB~

DIFFERENT STRATEGIES FOR DATASET SIZES:

- LESS THAN 1GB: PANDAS
- 1GB TO 100GB: 
- LARGER THAN THAT

STORE DATA IN EFFICIENT MEMORY FORMATS (COMPRESSION)
STORE DATA IN A DATABASE TO ALLOW SQL QUERIES

THERE IS A DIFFERENCE, WHEN USING PANDAS, WE MIGHT BE LOADING A LOT OF DATA AND TAKING
EXTRA HARDWARE RESOURCES, RESULTING ON LIMITED PROCESS.

### FOUR OPTIONS

- BUT MORE MEMORY
- STORE DATA IN EFFICIENT MEMORY FORMATS
- USE CHUNKING TO TRIM A ND THIN OUT YOUR DATA SO IT DOES FIT IN MEMORY
- BREAK YOUR JOB INTO PIECES AND DISTRIBUTE OVER MULTIPLE MACHINES

## CHUNKING

USEFUL WHEN YOU NEED TO PRECESS ALL DATA, BUT DON´T NEED TO LOAD ALL DATA AT ONCE INTO MEMORY.

SO, ONE COULD PROCESS ONE CHUNK AT A TIME

EXAMPLE: READ A BOOK ALL AT ONCE, BUT IF THE BOOK IS LARGE ENOUGH, THAN YOU SHOULD CHANGE STRATEGY, AND READ
IT PAGE BY PAGE.

### WHICH SIZE SHOULD BE SELECTED?

THERE IS ALWAYS A FIXED PROCESSING COST

AS LARGE AS THE CHUNK CAN BE, THE BETTER!

OF COURSE, AS LARGE AS YOU DON´T BREAK ALL PROCESS

## SCALE UP (VERTICAL SCALABILITY)

IT IS EXPENSIVE TO MOVE DATA BACK AND FORTH FROM MAIN MEMORY.

USUALLY, COMPUTER FILLS CACHE WITH DATA USED RECENTLY.

SCALING UP MEANS ADDING MORE RESOURCES, SUCH AS CPU, RAM AND DISK SPACE TO A SINGLE MACHINE.

EXAMPLE:

- EXPLORE 100 TB BY 1 NODE @ 50 MB/SEC = 23 DAYS

SOLUTION: DIVIDE AND CONQUER

VERTICAL SCALABILITY >> HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY

ADD MORE MEMORY, PROCESSORS

### ADVANTAGES

- LESS ENERGY CONSUMPTION (SINGLE MACHINE)
- LESS COST IN COOLING SYSTEMS
- EASIER TO IMPLEMENT SOLUTIONS

### DISADVANTAGES

- PRICE
- NO FAULT-TOLERANT
- LIMITED UPGRADES

## SCALE-OUT (HORIZONTAL SCALABILITY)

HIRE MORE WORKERS TO WORK IN PARALLEL

- PARALLEL COMPUTING
- DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING

ALLOWS COMPUTE THINGS MUCH FASTER AS WE ARE ABLE TO DO MANY THINGS AT THE SAME TIME.

YOU SHOULD ONLY USE DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IF:

- YOUR HOB IS HIGHLY PARALLELIZABLE
- YOU CANT DO THE JOB ON ONE COMPUTER BECAUSE THERE IS NO SPACE IN MEMORY

ADD MORE (CHEAPER) NODES

### ADVANTAGES

- CHEAPER
- FAULT TOLERANT IS POSSIBLE
- EASIER TO EXPAND

### DISADVANTAGES

- MORE PHYSUCAL SPACE
- ENERGY COSTS
- NETWORK EQUIPMENT

## GPU

PARALLEL COMPUTING INVOLVES PERFORMING CALCULATIONS OR PROCESSES SIMULTANEOUSLY.

### DEFINITION

POWERFUL PARALLEL PROCESSING ARCHTECTURE.

MORE ECONOMICAL SOLUTION FOR LOADING AND MANIPULATING DATA.

CPU PROCESS SEQUENTIALLY
GPUS PROCESS IN PARALLEL
