## MAP REDUCE

FRAMEWORK HADOOP WORKS ON MAP/REDUCE ALGORITHM, GATHERING RESULT ALL TOGETHER.

IT BREAKS DOWN DATA INTO SMALLER PIECES, AND USES PARALLEL PROCESSING, TIED IN A SINGLE HADOOP COMMODITY SERVER.


### HISTORY

EARLY 2000, ENGINEERS FROM GOOGLE STARTED THINKING ABOUT FUTURE SOLUTIONS.

DIVIDE AND CONQUER SPIRIT, FLOWING INTO PARALLEL PROCESSING.

TARGET IS TO REDUCE EXECUTION TIME, BY DIVING A SINGLE LARGER TASK INTO MULTIPLE SMALLER ONES. FINALLY, AT THE END, PUT IT ALL TOGETHER.


MAP REDUCE WAS AN OPEN SOURCE SOLUTION, WHICH WAS PRESENTED BY GOOGLE ENGINEERS. AFTER THAT, MANY OTHER PRIVATE COMPANIES STARTED WORKING ON PRODUCTS THAT WERE INITIALLY BASED ON OPEN SOURCE SOLUTION.

INTERESTING PAPER: "MAPREDUCE: SIMPLIFIED DATA PROCESSING ON LARGE CLUSTERS"

## HOW DOES IT WORK

### MAP

SPLIT LARGER TASK INTO SMALLER ONE.



### REDUCE

PERFORMED ON THE OUTPUT DATA FROM THE MAP TASK. REDUCES INTERMEDIATE TASKS UNTIL IT GETS INTO ONE SINGLE VALUE.

## ADVANTAGES

POWERFUL FRAMEWORK, REVOLUTIONIZED BIG DATA WORLD:

- SCALABILITY
- FAULT TOLERANCE: DUPLICATED DATA, ENSURING AVAILABILITY
- COST-EFFECTIVE: EACH SMALL TASK CAN BE PROCESSED ON A NORMAL COMPUTER, SO, HARDWARE EFFECTIVE
