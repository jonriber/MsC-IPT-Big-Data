LARGE SCALE DATA SCIENCE

    DATA SCIENCE IS:
        - QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS - UNDERSTAND THE DATA
        - PROGRAMMING - PROCESS YOUR DATA
        - STORYTELLING - OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT DATA MEANS

    TURN DATA INTO INFORMATION AND INFORMATION INTO INSIGHT

    BIG DATA IS NOT ABOUT THE DATA, IT IS ALL ABOUT THE ANALYTICS
    
    REFERS TO THE APPLICATION OF DATA SCIENCE TECHNIQUES, METHODS, AND TOOLS TO DEAL WITH LARGE VOLUME OF DATA

    MAP REDUCE ALGORITHM - INSIDE HADOOP

    OBJECTIVES:
        . STORE
        . PROCESS
        . ANALYSE

    MAP REDUCE: FACILITATE HOW DATA IS PROCESSED 

    ALGORITHMS:
        - RUNNING THROUGH DIFFERENT PLATFORMS
        - NOT CENTRALIZED

    PROCESSING TIMES:
        DUE TO THE FACT DATA IS HUGE, THEY NEED TO BE PRECESSED USING FRAMEWORKS (SPARK)

    DATA SOURCES:
        MULTIPLE SOURCES (SENSORS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, DEVICES....ETC)

    HISTORICALLY, EUA AND CHINA OWNS THE MARKET OF DATA PROCESSING, SINCE THEY STARTED ELECTRONICAL DEVELOPMENT, TRANSISTORS AND COMPUTERS

    DATA SCIENTIST MUST EXTRACT SIGNAL FROM NOISE.

    BIGGEST QUESTION IN DATA SCIENCE IS WHY???? CURIOSITY IS A KEY FACTOR IN THIS FIELD OF KNOLEDGE

    CREATIVITY WITH DATA
    SKEPTICISM
    GOOD COMMUNICATION SKILLS

    STREAM LIT IS A TOOL TO STREAM A PYTHON NOTEBOOK 

    BIG DATA ROLES:
        - DATABASE ADMIN
        - MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER
        - DATA WAREHOUSE DEVELOPER
        - DATA MINING ENGINEER 
        - DATA VISUALIZATION SPECIALIST

    DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLE:
        . BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
        . DATA AQUISITION AND UNDERSTANDING
        . DEPLOYMENT
        . MODELING

    CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES:
        - DATA QUALITY
        - PRIVACY AND SECURITY
        - INFRASTRUCTURE AND COSTS
        - LACK OF QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS
        - MODEL INTERPRETABILITY (MONEY MIGHT BE INVOLVED HERE)
        - ETHICS ANDA DATA BIAS
        - SUSTAINABLE INITIATIVES
        - HEALTH AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

    

DATA SCINCE IS THE BIG UMBRELLA
BIG DATA IS JUST A SECTION INSIDE OF IT
