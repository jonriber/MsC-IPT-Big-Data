        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nAccording to their design, the flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol should deliver a\nwide spectrum of \u201cmagical\u201d outcomes in all sectors of developing countries and transition\neconomies including, among others, technology and know-how transfer, skilled experts,\ninvestment capital, and capacity building. Buildings should, in theory, be prime targets of clean\ndevelopment mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI) projects since they house major\ncost-effective potentials for saving carbon-dioxide (CO2) through the improvement of energy\nefficiency all around the world. Host countries should welcome activities channeled to\nbuildings, as these mechanisms could help overcome barriers inhibiting the improvement of\nenergy efficiency in homes and businesses.\nWill these opportunities be realized? The paper examines the three flexible mechanisms\nof the Kyoto Protocol from the perspective of their promise to save energy in the buildings\nsector. First, it highlights the priority of the buildings sector for climate mitigation policies.\nThen, it reviews on-going JI and CDM projects, and planned activities. It examines the prime\nbarriers to the application of these mechanisms in buildings. Finally, the paper identifies a\nselection of opportunities for improving the present implementation of these mechanisms to\nbetter deliver the \u201cmagic\u201d in buildings. It concludes that introduction of such policies as Green\nInvestment Schemes (GIS) and project-based emission trading, methodological improvements\nfor JI and CDM, and capacity building programmes targeted to local audience may help to\novercome some of the barriers to implementation of these mechanisms in the buildings sector.\nIntroduction: the Magic of the Kyoto Mechanisms\nIn order to allow parties to meet their greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets in the\nmost cost-effective way, the Kyoto Protocol introduced the so-called \u201cflexible mechanisms\u201d.\nThese include international emission trading (IET) as defined by Article 17, the clean\ndevelopment mechanism (CDM) introduced in Article 12, and joint implementation (JI),\ndescribed in Article 6. IET provides incentives to foster investment in GHG reduction in the\nAnnex-I Parties of the Protocol when these countries are interested in producing a higher supply\nof Assigned Amount Units (AAUs) for allowance-based transactions1. The project-based\nmechanisms, i.e. the CDM and JI, were designed to decrease GHG emissions by providing the\nbackground for project-based transactions2.\nThe flexible mechanisms, especially the project-based mechanisms, were associated with\nthe promise of bringing a broad range of benefits to host countries. Such projects were expected\nto accelerate the transfer of energy-efficient and other advanced low-GHG technologies, to\n1 Under IET, an Annex-I Party may purchase some emission units under their assigned amount (allowances), AAUs,\ncreated and allocated by regulators under cap-and-trade regimes from another Annex-I Party.\n2 Under the project-base mechanisms, an Annex-I Party may purchase emission credits from a project that reduce\nGHG emissions for the amount different from the emissions taking place without this project. JI allows such\ntransactions from an Annex-I Party and such emission credits are called as Emission Reduction Units (ERUs), while\nCDM permits transaction of credits referred as Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) from a non-Annex I Party.",

THESES\nTHE NINTH LETTER OF PSEUDO-DIONYSIUS THE AREOPAGITE IN\nCHURCH SLAVONIC TRANSLATION: A STUDY ON SYMBOLIC THEOLOGY\nEvgeny Aphonasin (Russia)\nCompleted in the age of the full bloom of Byzantine theology, the Corpus Dionysiacum was\npredestined for rebirth wherever theological thought began its evolution in Christian\nsociety. It was the writing of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite that attracted the attention\nof the brilliant thinker of the ninth century, John Scot Eriugena. Five centuries later, the\nSlavonic theologian, Starets Isaiah, undertook the translation of the Corpus from Greek\ninto Church Slavonic. Slavic culture at the time of Isaiah was undergoing quick develop\u00ad\nment and finally took Christian shape by incorporating the traditional values of\nChristendom. Both the monk Isaiah and his creation took a part in this process. This new\nChurch Slavonic version of the Corpus makes it possible to look at the writings of the\nunknown Christian author from a different point of view and is worth investigating not\nonly as such but also for the sake of a better understanding of the text of Dionysius since\nit contains things which depend not upon particular linguistic expression.\nMy thesis is dedicated to one of the possible points of view, namely, the theory of sym\u00ad\nbolism and its place in the philosophy of Pseudo-Dionysius, analysed on the basis of the\nChurch Slavonic version. The lost or fictitious treatise, the Symbolic Theology, which was\nsupposed to have examined the application of perceptible images to divine things and to\nhave interpreted the anthropomorphism of certain biblical passages, would have been the\nmost voluminous among the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. However, it\nseems possible to assume that such a text never existed since we possess neither a frag\u00ad\nment of it nor a single allusion to it in the textual tradition. Therefore, the Ninth Letter of\nDionysius, being a short summary of this proposed treatise, attracts the attention of those\nwho search for a better understanding of the theory of symbolism. Besides this Letter, cer\u00ad\ntain chapters of the Celestial Hierarchy are also of value for any study on the place of sym\u00ad\nbols within the theological and philosophical synthesis made by the unknown thinker.\nThe theory of symbolism developed in the Corpus Dionysiacum can be read as fol\u00ad\nlows: the light of ineffable knowledge reveals itself in illuminated images and symbols\nwhich are the last link of the chain connecting the heavenly and earthly hierarchies. The\nhuman soul contemplates the true light of knowledge only through perceptible images\nwhich have grown around it, and it must strip these images off in order to see this light\nitself. Only after this, the human soul may ascend from sacred symbols to the simple and\ntranscendent divinity. As the connecting link, symbols, at the same time, reveal and con\u00ad\nceal. On the one hand, they reveal similarities in things, and on the other hand, they are\nquite different from them. So this latter manifestation of dissimilarities is preferablyabstract situations or notions, one should include grammatical relations into the seman\u00ad\ntical analysis. Moreover, I came to the conclusion that in this case, it would be necessary\nto investigate first the \"grammatical\" relations of Hungarian language, the conditions of\ntheir observation, and the manifestation of these observations in language, before con\u00ad\ntinuing the study of an abstract notion or a situation. Concepts are sometimes expressed\nin very various ways and often develop indirectly, so that, without the knowledge of our\ncomplex experiential basis reflected in grammar, it is difficult to determine their place\nwithin the group of metaphors.\nIn the case I investigate, an abstract notion, namely time is expressed and thus con\u00ad\nceptualised by the most basic domains of our experience which are rather more material\nthan abstract. While organising the material, I tried to take into consideration these basic\nexperiences, reflected in grammar, by contrast to the formerly used structuring around\noppositions, poles of value, and spatial orientation. In fact, exaggerating a little, I can say\nthat in my former research I used extra-linguistical categories to describe language,\ninstead of investigating more attentively the language itself, whereas drafting this thesis,\nI tried to reveal first the major experiential basis by a semantical analysis of grammatical\ncategories and then, to establish the groups of metaphors. In this way we can have a more\nadequate view on the notion of time within the Old and even the modern Hungarian Ian-abstract interpretation.\n9 THIS SENTENCE OF PETRITSI in italics corresponds to a passage of the Epilogue, in which he\nstates that only about the Trinity can we say that it is \"existent and supra-existent by\nitself\"; whereas, all the others are said to exist only \"as images and accidentally\"\n(216.28-30).\n10 Ibid. \u03bc6\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u00b1 3\u03b7\u00b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03bf \u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u00b1.\n\" The \"philosophers' daylight\" must refer to the Christ; I think that, for instance, when\nin the Epilogue Petritsi says \"let you, who contemplate spiritually and love our day\u00ad\nlight...,\" (220.19) that by \"our daylight\" he refers to the Christ.abstraction, how then\ncould the one be subsequent and the other first? If not one the same way,\nthen the first will be the One itself; whereas, the second will be one and\nnot one. However, if this unity24 has not its own hypostasis, it will be only\none. But if it has some hypostasis apart from the One, the One will be\nparticipated in by the not-one, and the self-perfection of the ONE-LIKE25\nwill attach it to the First, which is the One itself, and it will be god by par\u00ad\nticipation,26 like God. But the hypostasis of the not-one emerges through\n22 At this place, the Greek text in fact has \u03b1\u03a0 \"\u00b1 9e6\u00b1 \u03cc\u00b1\u03c4\u03ba\u03b5\u03b8\u20ac\u03bc \u03ad\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9, \u03b7\u03bd\u03bb\u03c0 TOI/ kv\u00f3t, which\nmeans simply, as Dodds translates it: \"Every god is participable, except the One.\"\nHowever, obviously this could not fit Petritsi's own Christian metaphysical system, and\nthis is why he changes almost everything in the proposition in such a way as to exclude\nany possibility of attributing his divergence from the extant Greek text to supposed tex\u00ad\ntual variants in the Greek manuscript he used. Thus \"every god,\" referring unquestion\u00ad\nably to pagan gods, becomes \"every god by participation,\" that is to say, by participation\nin the one God, an acceptable idea for Christian theology. Moreover, \"is participable\" is\nalso changed in a manner that normally cannot be translated into English. In this transla\u00ad\ntion, I have used the word \"participates\" without a supplement, which, although not cor\u00ad\nrect English, is the mirror-translation of the Georgian eziarebis, used by Petritsi, meaning\nthat the \"gods by participation,\" in fact, participate in something higher, a tautology if\never there has been one. However, Petritsi knows how to translate the Greek \u00a3\u03bc \u00b1\u03cc\u03c4\u03ba\u03b2\u03b8 , for\nwhich he has two separate terms, ziarebadi \"participable,\" and ziarebiti \"participated in.\"\nThe alternation leads Petritsi not only to tautology but also to complete logical inconsis\u00ad\ntency. Grammatically, from this sentence it follows that THE ONE is also among the \"gods\nby participation.\" Of course, Petritsi does not imply this.\n23 Petritsi omits here \u03c4\u03c9' \u03bd \u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd .\n24 Here Petritsi, seems to have read something like \u03c4\u03cc h> \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 ' \u03c4\u03bf, instead of \u03c4\u03cc \u03cd\u03c7 \u03bf \u00e8v \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5'-\n\u03c4\u03bf .\n25 For henads Petritsi often uses the term ONE-LIKE.\n26 Here Petritsi again uses \"god by participation\" for 9eo\u00b1, and we see explicitly that he\nimplies that the henads are also divinized by participation in the One.\n27 It is curious that here Petritsi follows exactly the Greek text and uses the term ziarebiti, i.e.\n\"participable\" and follows Proclus' meaning when he translates that the \"god by partici\u00ad\npation\" is PARTICIPATED not PARTICIPATES IN and that henads (\"unitary numbers\") that come\nafter the One are participable. This only confirms that his alterations come not out of mis\u00ad\nunderstanding but are purposeful, for grammatically Petritsi understands the text very\nwell, and when his purpose is not, so to say, \"switched on,\" he provides an unaltered text.abstraction of the divinized. Therefore, in them, knowledge of the multiplied and\npassible is unitary and impassible so that each object of knowledge of the \"know-\ner\"43 is divided, but the divine knowledge is indivisible. That of the divided and\nmutable is indivisible and immutable, that of the possible, is of necessity, and that\nof the undefined, is defined.44 In fact, the divine transcendence does not adopt\nany knowledge from inferior things in a way that it may have knowledge resem\u00ad\nbling the nature of the objects of knowledge. But as for the inferiors, they are\nmdefinite in relation to the divine definitions. They change in relation to the\nimmutable ones, and they receive the impassible in a passible way and the time\u00ad\nless in a temporal way. For the inferiors are able to separate from the superiors,\nbut the divine ones cannot accept anything from the inferiors.\nI prop.124.\nLearn that everything is in the divinized gods but in a better way In fact,\nthey have prescience and knowledge neither in an eternal nor in a temporal\nway but are above all those in a singular fashion.

A few sites were\nvisited now for the first time, and Professor John Klassen from Canada, a his-abstracts\nof the papers, see below, pp. 131-149) The highlight of the event, no doubt,\nwas the participation of Aron Gurevich, who also gave a well-attended public\nlecture on \"The Origins of European Individualism.\" It was only sad to see\nthat this great scholar, whose work had been appreciated in Budapest and\ncentral Europe many years before being accepted in Russia, could not see any\nmore the sites of his visit and the faces of his audience. Since 1994 Aron\nIakovlevich's eyesight has deteriorated to the point of virtually complete\nblindness.\nWe somewhat miscalculated the mood of our students and our own\nscheduling capabilitites, however. We set the dates of the workshop for the\ndays after the submission of the M.A. theses, expecting that students wouldAbstracts of the\ntheses can be read below, pp. 38-67) Eight M.A. candidates presented good\nreasons for extending their defenses till the end of the summer, at which time\nthree of them earned the master's degree; one defended later in 1996/97, and\nsome others are still working on their theses.\nWe have learned by now that for some of our students a year abroad in an\ninternational and interdisciplinary surrounding is of major value, even if they\ndo not complete a master's thesis but return home with a Certificate of\nAttendance. Most students, however, are able to overcome the multiple cul\u00ad\ntural, linguistic, and professional challenges even in a short academic year of\nnine to ten months. It is a very satisfying experience to encounter genuine\nsuccess stories here. Students whose English is at the beginning, even in mid\u00ad\nyear, alarmingly faulty, whose training from home is full of gaps and\nextremely old-fashioned, but who are able to assimilate new methods and\napproaches, then apply these skills to material in which they feel comfortable\nand present theses that deserve to be counted as a serious, however small,\ncontribution to knowledge. In 1995/96 we had examples of both extremes as\nwell as a good crop of fair and even outstanding scholarly achievement. It\nremains, of course, a challenge to formulate a curriculum and offer instruc\u00ad\ntion and guidance for all types of M.A. candidates at the same time. Every\nyear of our operation adds some insights into better ways and means of\naccomplishing this manifold task.\nIn the April competition for transfer into the Ph. D. program 17 students\n(14 from the M.A. class and three former graduates who had spent a year\naway from CEU) submitted their applications. The admissions committee,\nconsisting of senior resident faculty and three members of the Academic\nAdvisory Board, offered a place to 10 students, pending their successful\ndefense of the M.A. thesis, which all of them accomplished.\nWith the admission of 29 students to the M.A. class of 1996/97 in July we\nprepared for the first full slate of one M.A. class and three years of Ph.D. can\u00ad\ndidates that was to be the \"normal\" constituency of the program.\nIt belongs to this 1995/96 Annual to report on the first Summer University\ncourse offered by the department. Supported by the OSI's Higher Education\nSupport Program (HESP), this project is aimed at young professionals, espe\u00ad\ncially junior faculty, in Central and Eastern Europe and introduces them in\nshort two to four-week courses to the modern methods and skills in fields of\nCEU's competence. Our Department ran a month-long Summer University\non Computing in Medieval Studies during July 1996. Its main organizer and\ndirector, Professor Gerhard Jaritz regularly teaches computing classes forABSTRACTS OF THE M.A. THESES\nSAINT WENCESLAS' HAGIOGRAPHY\nIN THE THIRTEENTH AND FOURTEENTH CENTURIES\nDessislava Atanassova (Bulgaria)\nThe thesis aimed at comparing the legends written up to the mid-eleventh\ncentury with the lives of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The compar\u00ad\nison was done according to the peculiarities of the content. The main two\nquestions were, first, what kind of changes appeared, and second, how did\nthe notion of Wenceslas' sanctity and his image as a saint change?\nIn later lives of Wenceslas, three types of changes were established: the\nappearance of narrative elements completely unknown in the earlier tradi\u00ad\ntion, created by hagiographers or drawn from the chronicle tradition; struc\u00ad\ntural transposition of elements known by the earlier lives, but rearranged and\nreinterpreted; and third, a modification, transformation, and elaboration of\ncertain purely hagiographie themes and motifs, which were known by the\nearlier lives, but which acquired functions and emphases different from the\nprevious. Regarding these changes, two main tendencies can be traced. The\nimage of Wenceslas as a saint was affected by the state-political interpreta\u00ad\ntions and the growing popularity of his cult; also, his image was modified in\naccordance with the evolution of criteria for Christian perfection.\nRegarding the three types of changes, I observed the following:\n1. The main change in the content of the lives consists in the appearance of\nnarrative elements completely unknown in the earlier tradition. Concerning\nthe vita, there are two such changes, namely the story about his miraculous\nappearance in the court of the Emperor, and the story about the forester. In turn,\nmiracula appear to be quantitatively much more affected by changes. The\nappearance of the story in the Court of the Emperor and the new miracles about\nthe vision of the Danish King Eric and about the German who was struck dumb\n(both taken not from hagiographie, but from historical sources), could be inter\u00ad\npreted as a sign of the popularity and spread of St. Wenceslas' cult.\n2. The structural transposition of the Kou\u0159im episode from miracula to vita\nindicates considerable change in its interpretation. On the one hand, the\nepisode appears to be a manifestation of Wenceslas as a zealous propagator ofABSTRACTS\nINTERACTIONS OF MEDIEVAL MONASTIC CULTURES\nMETHODOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL PROBLEMS\nJ\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky (CEU)\nMedieval monastic cultures have been studied by various scholars (histori\u00ad\nans, art historians, church historians, archaeologists, etc.), but these studies\nusually represent two main research directions. One of them is based on the\nclassical history of the order according to the medieval traditions. The foun\u00ad\ndation of the given order, the emergence of new monastic ideas, and the spiri\u00ad\ntual and material culture of the monastic community are discussed in a\nchronological framework.\nIt has been argued that the history of an order can provide very important\ndata and historical conclusions for one type of monastic tradition, but that the\ninteractions of monastic cultures are hardly represented in this research direc\u00ad\ntion. The other problematic question is the interpretation of the historical\nprocesses seen from the point of view of one single monastic movement. The\ndevelopment of one order can be studied in different frameworks: the emer\u00ad\ngence, development, or decline can be connected with very different mean\u00ad\nings in the context of the history of monastic cultures, in European history or\nin the order's history in a given country.\nThe history of monasticism is representing the other main research direc\u00ad\ntion, and development, or evolution, plays a significant role in this frame\u00ad\nwork. Emergence and decline are crucial features of monastic movements,\nbut the history of a given order is only one layer of the universal history of\nmonasticism. Eremitic tradition and monastic or mendicant orders are usual\u00ad\nly discussed in one period and their interactions are in focus only in some par\u00ad\nticular historical periods. The emergence of the Cistercian order, or the effect\nof the ideas of St. Bernard on other monastic traditions are often discussed in\nthis type of monastic studies, but Benedictine and Cistercian interactions of\nthe later periods are rarely studied.\nOn the other hand, medieval monastic interactions have been discussed\nvery often within some of the fields of medieval studies. Monastic building\nworkshops were, and to some extent still are, very frequently mentioned asABSTRACTS\nAPOCALYPTIC EXPECTATIONS AROUND THE YEAR 1000\nRichard Landes (Boston University)\nFor over a century the approach of medieval historians to the question of les\nterreurs de Van mil has been dominated by the position that the image of a\nwhole generation filled with apocalyptic expectation at the approach of the\nyear 1000 was the creation of the Romantic historians of the mid-nineteenth\ncentury and had nothing to do with the reality of late tenth or early eleventh\ncentury European society As a result, none of the last century's ample discus\u00ad\nsion of the dramatic changes that mark this period - recently referred to as la\nmutation de l'an mil - have even considered the possibility of a role for apoca\u00ad\nlyptic thought in the social and cultural dynamics of the period. And yet, this\nargument dismissing the presence of any significant apocalyptic agitation\naround the year 1000 is flawed both factually and conceptually. On the con\u00ad\ntrary, looked at with an understanding of both the dynamics of apocalyptic\nbeliefs and the dynamics of cultural memory, the period around 1000 may\nwell mark one of the high water marks of such beliefs in European - or any -\ncivilization.\nThe \"anti-Terrors\" school's argument rests on five main points:\n1. People did not even know the date - peasants had no notion of chronolog\u00ad\nical time, elites used a variety of systems and even those using A.D. dis\u00ad\nagreed.\n2. There are no theological reasons for 1000 to have eschatological signifi\u00ad\ncance.\n3. There is almost no surviving evidence of any apocalyptic terrors from the\nperiod.\n4. The little that survives is not directly related to 1000, but to dates such as\n968,1010 and 1033.\n5. Therefore, we should not be surprised to find 1000 was a \"year like any\nother\" in which the normal train of medieval life - wars, councils, plough\u00ad\ning, and praying - went on in uninterrupted flow. The utter absence of\ndocumentation attesting to apocalyptic beliefs and movements is the\ndecisive proof.Abstracts of the Papers\nPresented to the Colloquium on Logos, Ethos, and Mythos in the Middle East\n& North Africa (LEM), Budapest, 18-22 September, 1995.\n\u2022 \"The Reconstruction of Shaikh 'Adi b.

The course is also aabstract, namely the principles and discussions of these\nprinciples to be found in the study of theology and philosophy. Rather than contain\u00ad\ning what could be learned by means of rote memorization, music got to the heart of\nmatter, the essence of basic principles. Its components, such as individual tones, could\nbe learned by a child, much as a child learned alphabetical letters and learned, as well,\nto place them within syntax. But the essential nature of particularity and particular\nincrement within continuity, that is, the abstraction upon which letters within syntax\nwas based, was accessible by thinking about how tones occured within the continuity\nof a melodic line. Thus, music formed a necessary approach to theology, which dis\u00ad\ncussed single event within temporality and eternity.\nThe goal of this seminar is to observe how this could be the case. The course,\ntherefore, is fundementally interdisciplinary due to the fact that it logically and sub\u00ad\nstantially relates the quadrivial arts, the analogical bridge of music, to theology-phi\u00ad\nlosophy, which, of course, was the goal of all study throughout the medieval period.ABSTRACTS OF THE M.A. THESES\nIXiatthaei Cracoviensis Epi\u0161tola ad a.b. Clarevalensem quern ad Conversione\nRuthenorum Invit\u00e2t as a Historical Source\nEvguenia Anichtchenko\nThe \"Letter of Matthew, bishop of Cracow, to Bernard of Clairvaux about the con\u00ad\nversion of the Ruthenians\" is a document widely used by scholars for more than two\ncenturies. Though often quoted as a historical source in support of theories and con\u00ad\nclusions, the document itself has still not received any definitive investigation. The\nenigmatic character of this document is obvious at first sight: according to the tradi\u00ad\ntional dating of this document, almost two hundred years after the Christianisation of\nRus', the author of the letter calls for the conversion of these lands. Thus, the main\nproblem raised by the \"Letter of Matthew\" is the question of the Catholic attitude\ntoward the Ruthenian Church and the historical background of this attitude.\nIn order to place this document into its proper context, a review of the scholar\u00ad\nship and research on the textual history of the document was made; then a textual\nanalysis was undertaken. On the basis of this research, some questions concerning the\nauthenticity of the document have emerged suggesting a Humanist origin of the text.\nA comparative historical analysis did not support the twelfth-century origin of the let\u00ad\nter either. However, an analysis of the historical circumstances of the thirteenth cen\u00ad\ntury provides some points for the incorporation of this document into that time, but\nleaves a number of questions open. It seems that the most appropriate period for the\nletter \"of Matthew\" is the fifteenth century. Nevertheless, in the current stage of the\ninvestigation, it is impossible to answer all questions which appeared in connection\nwith this new dating. Thus, the main result of this study was to focus attention on the\nnecessity of re-examining this document.\nThe Vitae of St. Aethelwold by Aelfric and Wulf stan: A Stylistic Aspect\nElena V. Barahan\nThis thesis offers a stylistic analysis of the two eleventh-century vitae of St.\nAethelwold by Aelfric and Wulfstan. The aim of the study is to aid the understanding\nof how language and style are involved in the process of constructing the image of aabstraction and precision\nin the narration. The details of the saint's life are viewed in an exegetic perspective.\nThe authors, while creating a picture of a saintly personality, use all the devices\naccording to different structural principles. Aelfric's vita has a clear linear structure. It\nis a string of separate stories in which specific incidents in the saint's life are treated as\na major means of creating an image of St. Aethelwold. Aelfric must have considered\nthat the saint's deeds narrated in an unsophisticated language would be quite pic\u00ad\nturesque in themselves and would suffice to convey his saintly nature. Unlike Aelfric,\nWulfstan, whose account also consists of separate episodes, embellishes the story of the\nsaint's life, expressing the idea of St. Aethelwold's sanctity indirectly as well by\nemploying numerous evaluative and emotionally coloured epithets, appositional\nseries, attributes, paraphrases, and metaphors, all of which have semantics of unique\u00ad\nness, domination, and holiness.\nTwo Polemics: St. John of Damascus's Apologetic Treatises Against Those who\nCalumniate Divine Images and Stefan Yavorsky's The Stone of Faith\nVladimir Baranov\nIn this study, two polemics in defence of icons were compared: John of Damascus' (675? -\nca 754) Apologetic Treatises Against Those Who Calumniate Divine Images [Apologies] and\nthe relevant text in The Stone of Faith by Metropolitan Stefan Yavorsky (1658-1722).Abstracts, 88-89.Abstracts of the Papers of the Pias tan y Bw\u00edch International Conference,\n19-25 September, 1997, eds.

Every shident is also assigned some scholarly task during the excursion.\nDuring the excursion of this academic year we are going to visit north-eastern\nHungary, Slovakia and southern Poland. Introductory lectures related to this regions\nare offered in the first part of the semester to help students to find their excursionabstraction (Augustine and Bonaventura vs. Aristotle\nand Aquinas). An overview on contemporary views on natural philosophy: creation\nand the eternity of the world, the problem of divine omnipotence as well as the soul\nand the problem of the active intellect is also provided.\nGerhard Jaritz\nComputing for Medievalists\nThe course concentrates on the application of databasing in medieval historical\nresearch, particularly by using the database management system \"KLEIO\" that has\nbeen developed at the \"Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Geschichte\" in G\u00f6ttingen\n(Germany). We combine methodological discussions with extensive possibilities for\npractical work.\nAt first, the example of the description, documentation and analysis of\npictorial sources play the main role, followed by the management of the contents of\nwritten sources like account books, testaments, inventories or chronicles. The usage\nof the students' \"own\" sources being relevant for their master theses, for their\nresearch projects, etc. is appreciated and supported. Major emphasis is put on the\nnecessity to stay as close to the sources as possible.\nWe concentrate on the following features: Easy and more complex data\nretrieval, indexes, catalogues and codebooks, full text analysis, the integration of\npictorial sources, and digital image analysis.abstract, namely the principles and\ndiscussions of these principles to be found in the study of theology-philosophy.\nRather than containing what could be learned by means of rote memorization, music\ngot to the heart of the matter, the essence of basic principles. Its components, such\nas individual tones, could be learned by a child, much as a child learned alphabet\u00ad\nical letters and learned, as well, to place them within syntax. But the essential\nnature of particularity and particular increment within continuity, that is, the\nabstraction upon which letters within syntax was based, was accessible by thinking\nabout how tones occurred within the continuity of a melodic line. Thus, music\nformed a necessary approach to theology, which discussed single event within\ntemporality and eternity. Extending a similar statement by Augustine, quoted above,\nRoger Bacon toward the end of the thirteenth century reiterated that without music\ntrue understanding of philosophy and theology remained inaccessible. The goal of\nthis seminar is to observe how this could be the case. The course, therefore, is\nfundamentally interdisciplinary due to the fact that it logically and substantially\nrelates the quadrivial arts, the analogical bridge of music, to theology-philosophy,\nwhich, of course, was the goal of all study throughout the medieval period.\nM\u00e1ria Dobozy\nThe Crusade Experience (East and West) in Literary Terms\nThis course looks at the early reactions to the crusades in the Middle East and\nNorthern Europe by reading eye-witness Latin accounts, Greek accounts, Islamic\nhistorians, and the German chronicles and other narrative works concerning the\ncrusades and the Holy Land. These texts all represent attempts by the authors to\nshape their audience's understanding not only of the events, but also of their own\nhistory. We discuss the topics of literary versus historical accounts, mimesis, narrat\u00ad\nive strategies, and cross-cultural and religious comparisons, the confrontation of the\nother, all of which are used to portray \"history\" or \"reality\" from the author's\ncultural perspective.abstract level of the thoughts they express, but arc on the other hand they are\naccessible because their vocabulary is particular but rather elementary. The\nsentences are long but surveyable because they express very interesting and\nfascinating ideas, which have proven to become insistent themes and motives in the\nhistory of later Greek and Byzantine literature and thought. Thus, while reading\nDionysius' Mystical theology and the first five Letters in full, and paying attention\nboth to their grammar and their content, the students acquire linguistic skill and\ncultural knowledge that is essential for approaching the Byzantine tradition.ABSTRACTS OF THE M.A. THESES\nSt Clement's Church of St Panteleimon:\nArchitectural History of a Medieval Monument in Ohrid\nBiljana Bogatinoska\nThis thesis investigates St Clement's Church of St Panteleimon, the most important\nSlavic-Christian church in the town of Ohrid. It deals with its history, its archi\u00ad\ntectural history, architecture, and art, in both its medieval and present-day context.\nIn addressing all of these aspects of St Clement's, this study attempts to examine\neach of them separately and in relation to each other, and thus to establish the\nimportance of the Church within the context of the architectural tradition in the\ntown of Ohrid, its surroundings, and in the context of Byzantine art and archi\u00ad\ntecture. The main idea is that by examining the church itself, its form, function,\nmaterials, method of construction, its exterior, its location, and its place in a defined\nperiod of time and geographical borders, the value of the church can be established.\nThus, from the architectural point of view, the church presents a unique combina\u00ad\ntion of a triconch and cross-in-square structure in the context of Early Christian and\nByzantine art and architecture. With its triconch structure St Clement's follows the\nbuilding tradition in Ohrid and its surroundings, and with the cross-in-square\nstructure it opens a new era in the architectural building tradition.\nBecause of the great importance of St Clement's Church, I propose a plan for an\nadditional excavation, in which a group of specialists from a wide range of\ndisciplines, such as archaeologists, architects, and art historians would take part.\nFollowing this there is a plan for conservation and restoration which would lead to a\nlarger architectural project for the urbanisation and revitalisation of the site, so that\nit can properly suit the needs of society. However, this new function for the com\u00ad\nmunity can only be achieved if chosen by the people themselves. As a contemporary\ntool for information a CD-ROM could present a first step in the process of revital\u00ad\nisation and could be viewed in the interior of the church where it would be available\nto every scholar and every visitor who is interested in learning more about the",

The land donations to Hungarian nobles placed some\nknezes under die lordship of nobles, and dius different categories of knezes\nappeared: knezes subject to nobles5 and the free knezes living on the domain of die\nroyal fortresses. When the kenesiatus of a knez was donated to a noble, die rights of\npossession and lordship attributes of die knez were diminished. These knezes were\nreduced to the role of intermediaries between die noble lord and the inhabitants of\ndie village. They acted as villici. They could judge the peasants of the village\nconcerning certain petty crimes, were charged widi maintaining order, the peasants\nowed diem obedience, and diey were responsible for the collection of dues in money,\nlabor, or kind. These knezes, being subject to a noble, forfeited the opportunity to\nbecome nobles themselves as long as they remained on the noble domain.6 In the\nRadu Popa, Tara Maramuresului \u00een veacul al XlV-lea (The Country of Maramures, in the fourteenth\ncentury), 2lld edition, (Bucharest: Editura Enciclopedic\u00e4, 1997); Radu Popa, La \u00eenceputurile evului mediu\nrom\u00e2nesc. fara Hafegului (The beginnings of the Romanian Middle Ages: The Country of the Hafeg)\n(Bucharest: Editura \u00c7tiinpTica \u00e7i Enciclopedic\u00e4, 1988), 165-184.\ns .\nAn example of such subjection is that of the knez called Bach, dispossesed in 1320 of his possessions in\nfavour of Ladislas Himfy.

As a\nresult, these two texts, different in audiority, cannot be distinguished from each\nother by an ordinary user. Due to such a method of compilation, the canon law\ncorpus of die Ordiodox church was given a strong imprint of Blastares' personal\nbias towards die ideology promulgated by the patriarchate of Constantinople in the\nfourteenth century. There are reasons to believe that the Slavonic translation, in its\nturn, was completed by the supporters of this patriarchate or even commissioned and\npromoted directly by Constantinople. In terms of cultural history, diis translation\nshould be considered one of the extreme manifestations of die movement in the\nOrdiodox Slavonic countries which was orientated strongly towards Byzantium and\nimitated it on many levels in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\nOne of characteristics of the Syntagma is its sharp anti-Latin attitude. In\ngeneral, diere are eleven scholia against Latins in this code: three concern the most\ncrucial problems of polemics between die Greek and Latin churches; the other seven\ntouch upon issues which may appear today as minor. Blastares is never original in\nhis choice of subjects for the polemics, following tradition. The direct source of his\nnine polemical scholia is die commentary Theodor Balsamon, a great Byzantine\ncommentator of die twelfth century. At the same time, Blastares frequently\ntransforms his sources, sometimes considerably. The most interesting example of\nsuch a transformation is die prohibition against mixed marriages between OrthodoxAbstract of the dissertation\nThis dissertation is devoted to the history of the servants known in Islamic literature\nas Saqaliba. The research aims at a complex study of the saqlabl servants' history in\nconnection with general historical processes of the Early Middle Ages. The goal dius\nestablished presupposes studies in European history (the importation of saqlabl\ncaptives to the Islamic world) as well as in Islamic (history of the saqlabl servants in\nal-Andalus and North Africa); therefore, both Western and Oriental sources are used.\nAlthough saqlabl servants are referred to in many sources, the reconstruction of\ntheir history presents a difficult task. As a matter of fact, even the sense of the word\nSaqaliba is interpreted in various ways\u2014as Slavs, European slaves, eunuchs, etc.\nTherefore, the research begins with an attempt to ascertain the sense of the word\nSaqaliba as applied to servants in the medieval Islamic world. An analysis of the\nmost illustrative cases of the use of the word Saqaliba by Islamic writers reveals that\nthe name in question was applied to a particular group of servants, those originating\nfrom the people of Saqaliba.\nThis conclusion poses another problem, that of the identification- of the \"people\nof Saqaliba\" To resolve this problem, a study of references to Saqaliba in Islamic\ngeographical literature is carried out. Accounts of travellers who visited Central and\nEastern Europe and saw the Saqaliba with their own eyes are regarded as the most\nauthentic and trustworthy evidence. These writers usually apply the name Saqaliba to",

On the other hand, the author of\nthe CC does not hesitate to specify the objects in straightforward, down-to-\nearth terms in places where the text of the Bible tends to be rather vague,\nstressing its allegorical meaning. Thus, for example, while in the Bible\nHabakkuk brings to Daniel simply food,35 the CC reads: intulit intritam Abacuc.36\n(Intrita is soup in which bread is mixed with water, honey, wine or milk.)\nIt is possible, although it obviously cannot be proven that some of the\nspecifications are based on pictorial representations of the relevant Biblical\npassages\u2014a picture cannot avoid to \u2018describe\u2019 which can easily be evaded in a\npiece of writing. This suggestion would explain the allusions in the catalogue of\ndressing, where most of the characters wear robes in specific colors, which,\nhowever, cannot be easily connected to or justified by their story or\ncharacteristics in the Bible.37\nWhile the words are specified or abstracted, the stylistic level is often\nchanged as well. The author of the CC mixes together the high and low style\nusing various genres such as epics, comedy, or farce. The stylistic variety of the\ntext is one of the basic means of familiarizing of the Bible in the CC and it\nforms a significant component of its overall variety.\nThe CC abounds in word plays and puns, but they are mostly catalogue-\nbound: they occur primarily in the catalogues of eating fish and drinking wine.\nThese two catalogues include the most specific attributions\u2014the guests drink\nspecific kinds of wine and eat specific kinds of fish. This is only possible\nthrough word plays\u2014there are not so many types of wine and fish in the Bible.\nMany of these allusions work well on both the levels: they can be related to the\nBible and they are meaningful within the context of the CC as well. For\nexample Jesus drinks passum38\u2014which means \u201craisin wine\u201d and alludes to Jesus\nsuffering (passio) at the same time. Or he eats assellum\u2014which means a \u201ccod\u201d,\nbut also an \u201cass\u201d reminiscent of Jesus\u2019 arrival in Jerusalem.39\n33 Judges 11.30\u201331.\n34 Line 74a.\n35 Daniel 14.33\u201334.\n36 Line 94b.\n37 The notion of colors in the CC is a very complex issue worth of further study.\n38 Line 150a. It refers to e.g. Matthew 17.12.\n39 Line 126. It refers to John 12.14\u201315.\n190abstraction, as the\ntree to which he climbs is specified as sycamore in the Bible, then he eats\nsycamore (sicomorum),91 which is a shift in meaning from the tree to its fruit.\nAnd finally he drinks Arbustan wine (arbustinum)92 which is an easy pun on the\nalready mentioned tree (arbor). If we assume that the CC had an educational\nfunction, it can be easily explained as \u2018revision of the previous lesson,\u2019 which\nthe author of the CC, as a good teacher, includes among the \u2018new lesson mater-\nial\u2019. More often, however, more events from the \u2018life\u2019 of a Biblical character or\nmore roles of the character are alluded to through more different methods.\nIn addition, there are two occasions in the CC in which one character is\ndescribed both as agens and patiens of the same action. These are: Noah closed\nand was closed clusit93 and includitur94 and Absolon hanged and was hanged\nsuspendit95 and suspenditur.96 In both occasions, the same event is alluded to\u2014\nNoah was enclosed in the ark by God, and Absolon stuck among the boughs of\na tree. For Noah the event means life, for Absolon death. These lines provide a\ngood example of another way the author of the CC played with the voice of the\nverb.\nThere are instances where a play with the voice includes different\ncharacters, one character is described as an agens of an action, and another one\nas patiens of the very same action. The characters are thus linked to each other.\n97\n80a Rahab alligavit bound98\n242b Joseph alligatur was bound99\n279a Jesus flagello (percussit) flagellated100\n246a Paul flagellatur was flagellated101\n90 Line 22b.

To achieve this goal, I had not\nonly to translate the epistles, but also to make them \u201creadable,\u201d in other words\nto provide commentaries for them, and to present the historical context, as well\nas to offer my views on some of the aspects of the literary sphere of the\nepistles. The translation is not a translation of the documents as historical\nsources, with attention focused on the information ignoring the style. Rather, I\nhave tried to translate the selected epistles as literary texts, keeping the English\nas close to the original as I could. Unfortunately, there were many places where\nthe peculiarities of Old Russian text were lost, both because of differences in\nthe structures of English and Russian and because of the impossibility of\nexpressing tiny details of the Russian text.\nThe structure of the work is determined by its aim. The first part of the\nthesis is the introduction to this field of study, providing facts on the history of\nthe period when Avvakum lived and created his compositions. This part also\nprovides information about the life of Avvakum, to give readers an impression\nof his personality. The second part of the work contains the translated texts of\nthe epistles ascribed to Avvakum, with my notes on them, which aim at helping\nthe reader to follow the text. Discussion of features of the literary sphere of the\nepistles is not included in the commentaries, because the third part of the work\nis dedicated to their study. The material analysed in the third part of the work\ndemonstrates that, while the epistles attributed to Avvakum can no longer be\nregarded as a literary whole belonging to the hand of one author, they are styl-\nistically diverse and rich epistolary works. Even if they were written by different\n293Abstracts\nOld Believer publicists, they are consistent in the usage of the imagery system,\nwhich reflects the system of views of the Old Believers on the world arrange-\nment, their conception of sin and righteousness, and their eschatological con-\ncepts as well. Thus, these epistolary works do not lose their significance for the\nstudy of Old Russian literature and do not stop being precious sources on the\nlife of the Old Believer community; on the contrary, in the light of recent re-\nsearch undertaken by Gabriele Scheidegger, the epistles attributed earlier to\nAvvakum could permit and facilitate a review of many historical and literary\ndata concerning the schism of Russian Orthodox Church and Old Believer\nmovement.\n\u201cWe are such stuff as dreams are made on\u201d: Dream Healing in the\nTemple of Epidaurus and in the Church of SS. Cosmas and Damian\nIldik\u00f3 Csepregi (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: Gy\u00f6rgy Karsai, G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: Sofia Boesch-Gajano (Terza Universit\u00e0 di Studi di Roma)\nI have focused my research here on the practice of temple sleep, and more\nprecisely on dream healing. This practice is called incubatio in Latin, enkoimesis in\nGreek, a practice during which the god sent dreams to those who came to be\nhealed or to consult him about things unknown to them. When it found itself\nface to face with these deeply-rooted beliefs, the early Church had to take\naccount of the challenge they posed and adapt to it, integrating genuinely pagan\ndream practices into its own system of beliefs.\nI am interested in this confrontation of Christian and pagan traditions,\nand in the question of how the Church succeeded in modifying ancient dream\nhealing and turning its cultic use to its own advantage by incorporating it into\nthe cult of the saints.\nWithin the scope of my M.A. thesis I have chosen two examples for this\nsurvey: the Classical Greek collection of Asclepieian miraculous cures per-\nformed at Epidaurus, preserved in the corpus of votive inscriptions at the\nsanctuary, and the miracle-collection of the physician saints Cosmas and\nDamian, whose recorded healings took place in Constantinople.\nAt the start, I give a short overview of the concept of the miraculous as it\nwas understood in the changing terms of Greek religious experience, gaining,\nlater on, absolutely different connotations with the change of the religious cli-\nmate after the coming of Christianity. In the second part of the thesis, I analyse\nthe two miracle collections, each separately, after introducing the persons of the\n294Abstracts\nhealers\u2014first the god and hero Asclepius, his incubation cult, his uniqueness\nwithin Greek religion and his figure as opposed to Christ. To facilitate the ex-\namination of the miraculous cures, I establish a typology of dream-healing,\nnoting recurrent motifs and themes specific to this record. In the third part, I\nfocus on Christian ideas about incubation, afterwards presenting the figures of\nSS. Cosmas and Damian as they are reflected in the hagiographic tradition. The\nmain body of the thesis consists of a study of their miracle-collection, followed\nby a comparison of the motifs and topoi of the incubation records, cataloguing\nthemes present only in ancient pagan dream-healing, themes shared by both\npagan and Christian temple-cures, and finally the exclusively Christian themes\ndepicted in the miracle-collection. By way of conclusion, I try to show the\nsimilarities and differences between incubation-practices of different periods:\nhow incubation was integrated by the church, and what the consequences of\nthis were in the modification of the healing miracle as a narrative genre.\nFood, Fight and Familiarity with the Bible:\nA Textual Analysis of the Cena Cypriani\nLucie Dole\u017ealov\u00e1 (Czech Republic)\nThesis Supervisors: Gerhard Jaritz, Gy\u00f6rgy Karsai, G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: Reinhold Glei (Universit\u00e4t Bochum)\nThe title is an attempt to briefly allude to the specific character of the obscure\nLatin text called Cena Cypriani. The Cena Cypriani, written probably in the second\nhalf of the fourth century and surviving in 54 manuscripts, cannot easily be cat-\negorised. The text not only combines elements of many different Late Antique\ngenres and literary types, but also seems to involve contradictory elements.\nBeing based on the Bible, it has been interpreted both as allegory and as par-\nody, as a religious text and as a blasphemy. Containing catalogues with Biblical\ncharacters and their attributions, it has been called both a mnemotechnic help\nor aide de memoire and an exertitium ingenii. Being very entertaining, it has been\nperceived both as a youthful lapse of a Church Father and as a playful joke.\nBaffled by such strong disagreement among scholars, I considered all\npossible contexts where the Cena Cypriani could be placed, I translated the text\ninto English, and studied each of the 472 Biblical allusions again. Based on this\nanalysis, I concentrated on the author\u2019s methods: the choice of the sources, the\nstrategies of attributing, tendencies in cataloguing and in creating the plot. It\nturned out that the author chooses primarily the most exciting, popular and\n295Abstracts\nplot-dense stories from the Bible\u2014violent and miraculous events and tricks, as\nwell as scenes where eating and drinking are involved.\nThere are various types of attributions\u2014some are based on association,\nsome on implication, wordplay or metaphor. Some are closely tied to the text\nof the Bible, others are distant from it. The attributions are distributed on many\nlevels\u2014some are familiar, others surprising, some are easy to recognise, others\ndifficult or almost impossible.\nThe catalogues seem to be organised without a specific strategy; only a\nfew tendencies can be detected. The plot connecting the individual catalogues is\nrather weak\u2014it depends solely on the character of the king, the organiser of the\nfeast. This can be perceived as another allusion.\nAfter the analysis of the author\u2019s methods, I return to the problem of the\nliterary genres and types, and re-evaluate their importance for the Cena Cypriani.\nI conclude that the author includes contradictions and ambiguities on purpose,\nand the result is closest to the exertitium ingenii.\nI propose the hypothesis that the purpose of the whole is both to amuse\nand to educate, in the broader sense of the word\u2014to draw the reader\u2019s or\nlistener\u2019s attention to the Bible\u2014and that the audience was a larger public\nwithin an elite: educated people familiar with the Bible. But this question,\ntogether with many others, remains open.\nThe study could be a starting point for further research on medieval re-\nwritings of the Cena Cypriani. Comparing these versions with the original could\nprovide useful conclusions about the shifts between the Late Antique and\nmedieval idea of education through entertainment, interpretations, and trans-\nmission of the texts.\nPrayer and Contemplation in the Century\nof Kallistos and Ignatios Xanthopoulos\nLaura Enache (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Andrew Louth (University of Durham)\nDealing with the theological problem of the knowledge of God, this study\nshows the way forward to a re-evaluation of the hesychast movement from the\npoint of view of the ascetics. It is meant to analyse, in the contemporary cul-\ntural context, the work Method and Canon or Chapters on Prayer, or Spiritual Century\nof Kallistos and Ignatios Xanthopoulos, two monks who had attained the per-\nfection of the ascetic life and contemplation. Their work, written with highly\n296Abstracts\ncultivated stylistic features, and both a good philosophical and a good theo-\nlogical background, is a synthesis of the hesychast Orthodox tradition going\nback to St. Evagrius of Pontus, Macarius the Egyptian and Isaac the Syrian. Al-\nthough a compilation of texts gathered from the Patristic and ascetic writings,\nthe work is \u201carchitectured\u201d\u2014to use Kallistos\u2019 own description\u2014on the model\nof a monument: each part, or each component quotation from the Holy\nTradition, plays the role of a brick. Once added to other bricks in an orderly\nmanner, following at the same time the ascetic stages of contemplation, each\ngains a new significance, since all the bricks are meant to reconstruct the\nhesychast doctrine in its Orthodox fundamentals. That is why we first analysed\nthis work as an implicit plea for the hesychast movement.\nThe first chapter raises problems of authenticity and authorship, drawing\nsome conjectures with regard to the place and dating of this work, while trying\nto contextualise this writing within the most important historical events of the\nepoch\u2014that is to say, besides the hesychast controversies, the civil wars which\nsplit Byzantine society into two hostile camps: Cantacuzeni against Palaeologi.\nThe second chapter is a propedeutic to the problem of knowledge of God,\nanalysing the theologico-ascetic grounds of the theme of contemplation in its\nontological settings. The third chapter has in its view the practical aspect of the\ntheme of contemplation; it deals properly with ascetics and the defining of\nhesychia in the understanding of the hesychast Fathers.\nThe fourth chapter analyses further the hesychast terms of contemplation\nand vision, focusing especially on Palamite terms which raised opposition and\ncontestation among the philosophers who followed Barlaam\u2019s opinions, during\nthe conciliar debates with Akyndynos. This terminological analysis was under-\ntaken in order to show the Palamite orientation of the Method and its closeness\nto the conciliar period The comparison between St. Gregory Palamas\u2019 One\nHundred and Fifty Chapters to the text of the Method and Canon was meant to show\nthe presence of the Palamite terminology within the traditional text of Kallistos\nand Ignatios Xanthopoulos. Although we tried to cover a large area of prob-\nlems, we had, however, to limit our research, due to the lack of information we\nencountered during the research process concerning the life, the work, and\neven the cultural historical context of those authors, all of which we had to\nrebuild. Future further research based more on the study of the manuscripts\ncould be revelatory for the acknowledgement of hesychasm itself, as could that\nrelated to the dating or the place of this writing.\nOur methods combined principles of logical enquiry, while investigating,\nfor instance, contradictory elements that we detected in the biography of the\nauthors, and temporal and spatial inconsistencies; some historical hints have\n297Abstracts\nhelped us to fix a mental framework or model of Byzantine society in this\nperiod, which makes this study an interdisciplinary approach to hesychasm.\nByzantine Humour with Reference to Michael Psellos\u2019 Chronography,\nAnna Komnene\u2019s Alexiad, and Eustathios of Thessaloniki\u2019s\nThe Capture of Thessaloniki\nDragana Eremi\u0107 (Yugoslavia)\nThesis Supervisors: Andrew Palmer, Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Wolfram H\u00f6randner (Universit\u00e4t Wien)\nGeneral encyclopaedias usually pay no attention to the Byzantine contribution\nto humour in literature. However, the work of some scholars has fortunately\nreminded us that by ignoring it we distort the picture of European medieval\nculture and historical development in general. The aim of the present thesis is\nto show some of the ways in which the Byzantines used humour in their works.\nI shall look specifically at Michael Psellos\u2019 Chronography, Anna Komnene\u2019s\nAlexiad, and Eustathios of Thessaloniki\u2019s The Capture of Thessaloniki.\nThe reason why these three people have been selected is as follows. They\nshared the same educational and cultural background, and were all certainly\nvery \u201curban.\u201d As well as implying \u201curbanity,\u201d this word should be taken in the\nstricter sense: all three had their mindset and mores developed by the urban\nenvironment, specifically that of Constantinople.\nMy aim is to define more accurately those qualities that seem to me to\nbelong to these Byzantine writers, and to illustrate them from their writings.\nMoreover, I try to differentiate between their personal brands of humour. It\nmight be argued that the very concept of Byzantine humour in at least one of\nthese cases is a petitio principii: can a woman as haughty and sullen as Anne\nKomnene be said to have had a sense of humour\u2014as opposed to mere\nsardonicism or spite\u2014at all? I hope that I pose, and answer this question,\nrather than begging it. The result is a collection and analysis of a number of\npassages, through which I show what I mean by Byzantine humour at this time.\nWe can conclude that Byzantines were, at least sometimes, humorous.\nThere is evidence in all three of the works under discussion that the Byzantines\ndid appreciate and enjoy humour. Of course, to what extent they amuse the\nreader (their peers, their contemporaries, later compilators or commentators,\nand now the modern audience) is a moot point, depending heavily on individual\ntaste. However, certain distinctive\u2014and presumably effective\u2014features may be\nacknowledged. From the examples taken from the three authors, we can see\n298Abstracts\nthat one common feature of their humour is often little more than mordant\nmockery, the expression of disdain for certain others, usually people from the\nlower classes, or foreigners (for being Constantinopolitan did not necessarily\nmean being cosmopolitan in all respects). However, while remaining con-\ntemptuous, they display a spark of ironic wit\u2014which is to say they employ\ndistancing techniques, which thereby make their comments less vicious. This\nwit is then finely tuned to create elegant phraseology.\nThe present study only scratches the surface of the material available, and\nonly hints at the extensive work that needs to be done. I do not argue that the\nByzantines were great comedians, or that we can claim for many Byzantine\nauthors that they were particularly hilarious, but merely that Byzantine humour\nhas hardly been recognised or acknowledged hitherto, and that many Byzantine\nwriters have been treated simply as exemplars of their supposedly static and\nsolemn, bureaucratic and theocratic culture (itself a post hoc construct in a post-\nByzantine image repertoire of received opinion, and thus another petitio principii)\nand have thus been misread.\nAmbivalent Origins of Female Sainthood and Heresy\nD\u00e1vid Falvay (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: Marina Benedetti (Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano)\nThe topic of my MA thesis is the special connection between Central European\nfemale sainthood and late medieval Western European cults of heretical\nwomen. The heretics chosen for my two case studies are Marguerite Porete and\nGuglielma of Milan, who were both connected in one way or another to\nCentral European female sainthood.\nIn the first, introductory, chapter, I investigate general issues connected to\nmy specific topic. After some remarks concerning the historiography, I discuss\nin general the problem of female sainthood and heresy.\nIn Porete\u2019s case, this relationship figures in three late medieval Italian\nmanuscripts of her famous mystical treatise entitled Miroir des Simples Ames. In\nthe three examples, the authorship was attributed to Margaret of Hungary, and\nin two manuscripts this attribution was supported by an appendix containing\nthe apocryphal story of Margaret of Hungary\u2019s stigmatisation. In my investiga-\ntion, I analyse the corpus of the manuscripts of the Miroir, I try to reconstruct\nthe affiliation of the surviving manuscripts, to find the place of the three Italian\nones featuring Margaret of Hungary\u2019s \u201cauthorship,\u201d and, following this, I deal\n299Abstracts\nwith Margaret of Hungary\u2019s Italian cult, to investigate the context in which this\n\u201ccontamination\u201d of the manuscripts took place. I summarise the case of the\nstory of Margaret\u2019s stigmatisation, which to some extent formed the literary and\nspiritual context for this false attribution. As a conclusion to this part, I\nformulate a working hypothesis concerning the reasons why and the ways how\nthe name of Margaret of Hungary was used to cover this heretical book written\nby Marguerite Porete.\nIn the case of Guglielma, we can speak about a double connection. On\nthe one hand, Guglielma of Milan was believed to have been a Bohemian\nprincess; on the other, a late hagiographic tradition contaminated her name\nwith a legend that spoke about a certain Saint Guglielma, princess of England\nand queen of Hungary. In this part of my thesis, I try to summarise the source\nmaterial concerning this tradition, since it has not yet been studied in detail in\nthe scholarship, and I try to reconstruct its literary and spiritual context.\nIn my general chapter, dealing with the stories\u2019 (and protagonists\u2019) Central\nEuropean origin as attribute, I attempt to put the whole issue into a wider con-\ntext, investigating how Hungary and Central Europe existed in the religious\nimagination of the medieval West, how the connotation of the \u201cCentral\nEuropean Princess/Queen\u201d attribute changed between the thirteenth and the\nfourteenth century, and how our two main case studies may be situated in this\ncontext.\nThe Latin Tradition of Aristotle\u2019s De anima (1120\u20131270):\nThe Relationship between Text and Commentary\nR\u00e9ka Forrai (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: Gy\u00f6rgy Ger\u00e9by\nExternal Reader: Jozef Brams (Hoger Instituut voor Wijsbegeerte, Leuven)\nThis study aims at an examination of the importance of medieval philosophical\ntranslations, based on a methodological experiment which consists of a com-\nparative textual analysis of different Latin translations of Aristotle\u2019s De anima\n(James of Venice, William of Moerbeke and Johannes Argyropulos) and some\nrelated commentaries (Themistius, Philoponus, Albert the Great and Thomas\nAquinas). The two constitutive elements of this comparison were important\ncomponents of medieval philosophical learning. Translations into Latin were\nthe elementary prerequisites for the dissemination of Greek philosophical\nworks, and the commentary was the most widespread genre of philosophical\n300Abstracts\nwriting, providing the framework in which the interpretation of Aristotle\u2019s work\ndeveloped.\nThe analytical part of my thesis is concerned with the interactions between\nthese two elements. Thus, the investigation led me in two entirely opposite\ndirections:\na) the relationship between medieval Latin translations and ancient com-\nmentaries; the commentary as auxiliary tool for translation;\nb) the relationship between medieval Latin translations and medieval\ncommentaries; the influence of the Latin version on the medieval inter-\npretations.\nConcerning the structure of the thesis, based on the elements which were\nthe subject of examination, we have divided our material into lexical and gram-\nmatical analyses. In the first part we investigate the different versions of\nproblematic philosophical terms, while in the second part the selected passages\nare interesting because the different interpretations of grammatical structures\nlead to various interpretations on the semantic level as well.\nThe interactions proved to be more complex than we supposed. In the\ncase of William of Moerbeke, there are certain elements which indicate that he\nused the ancient commentaries to revise his previous translations. We also\nencountered situations where the obscure old translation confused medieval\ncommentators, and cases where the exegesis was governed by the under-\nstanding of the translator. It turned out that in the specific case of the De anima\nthe rival Arabico-Latin translations and commentaries (Averroes) were widely\ninfluential. Nevertheless, certain results of our investigation may serve as a\nwarning about the overestimation of the translations in the context of medieval\nphilosophical learning. Moreover, certain problems related to the transmission\nof these texts call our attention to the limits of our approach.\nHowever, my partial results should certainly be checked against other\ntranslations as well: the study of the (in)dependence of the translation, and the\nrelative prestige of text and commentary, are both promising directions for\nfurther research. The comparative analysis of medieval and Humanist trans-\nlation, the detailed investigation of which was beyond the scope of the present\nthesis, would also open new questions and perspectives in the study of\nmedieval philosophical translations.\n301Abstracts\nBohemian Sheep, Hungarian Horses and Polish Wild Boars:\nAnimals in Twelfth-Century Central European Chronicles\nKrisztina F\u00fcgedi (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: J\u00e1nos M. Bak, Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Robert Delort (Universit\u00e9 Paris VIII)\nIn this study, I compared three Central European chronicles: the Chronicon\nBohemorum of Cosmas of Prague, the Chronicae et Gesta Ducum sive Principum\nPolonorum of the so-called Gallus Anonymous, and the part of the Hungarian\nIlluminated Chronicle probably dating from the twelfth century. Several objects or\nphenomena offer scope for a comparison that might give a detailed overview of\nthe thinking and education of the authors and their use of different sources. I\nchose the study of animals because I think that they held a unique position in\nevery important field of medieval society.\nAltogether there are 386 animals of 64 different types in the three\nchronicles. Cosmas used the most animals, and also the most different ones,\ncompared both to Gallus and to the Illuminated Chronicle. Cosmas did not only\nconcentrate on mammals, birds and reptiles, as the other two did, but used\namphibians and insects as well. Furthermore, he mentioned the most exotic\nanimals, which included species that do not originate in Central Europe, and\nthose that today are regarded as \u201cmythological.\u201d He may have written for more\neducated people, who would have had a wider overview of nature and also\nliterature; that is why he could more easily refer to animals that were not so\nclose to the audience. Conversely, however, if we investigate the use of\ndomestic versus non-domestic animals, we find also that Cosmas, who was\nseemingly fond of unusual aspects of rarely or never seen animals, referred\nregularly to those which one saw every day working in the fields.\nA further investigation for the use of animals in connection with hunting\nshows that Gallus used a remarkably high proportion of them. This is not\nsurprising if we consider how much he was involved in the depiction of the\nnobility\u2019s life, and how much he wanted to praise his king\u2019s virtues\u2014also by\ndepicting him as an excellent hunter.\nFor Gallus and the Hungarian author, animals without additional meaning\nplayed the most important role. It is interesting, however, that the Hungarian\nChronicle used more animals in the sense of value than were used in the\n\u201clearned\u201d internal comparisons that were the second most important for Gallus\nand of the utmost relevance for Cosmas. This shows that in the Hungarian\ntradition it was more deeply rooted to value an animal from different points of\nview than to use it in abstract comparison, and relatively, the Hungarian Chronicle\n302Abstracts\nused the most animals for cultural comparison among the three chroniclers.\nThis is because Hungarian society was deeply rooted in tradition, which vener-\nated animals highly, and because of this they ascribed supernatural power to\nthem in many cases. Furthermore, they accepted the fact that some animals\ncould decide the social ranks of humans.\nInvestigating possible literary patterns, I found that all three of the\nchronicles used the Bible for the most part, but the chroniclers might also have\nread Virgil, Horace, Sallust, Ovid, and several medieval authors, such as Regino\nof Pr\u00fcm, Thiethmar, Lampert, Einhard or Adamus. Cosmas applied the widest\npalette of Classical sources, while the Hungarian author leaned almost exclus-\nively on the Bible and medieval sources.\nThe Human within the Beast:\nCognitive Patterns in Brunetto Latini\u2019s Bestiary\nCristina Ionescu (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Caroline Gallacci (Clio and Associates, Tacoma)\nThe present analysis is an insight into medieval cognition. Since for the medi-\neval mind the world is an epiphany, the order of things need not be invented,\nbut, rather, discovered, as it is immanent to reality. The encyclopaedia is the lin-\nguistic transcript of the primarily mental exercise of encompassing a compre-\nhensive worldview, while the bestiary accommodated within it is the expression\nof society and the human position in God\u2019s creation.\nThis exercise, focused on the treatise of animal history, endeavours to\nreveal the basic patterns of the medieval mind, exposing them as totally devoid\nof any further rational determinations, in order to obtain a better understanding\nof the expanded result\u2014that is, the fully developed cultural phenomenon. The\nchoice of Brunetto Latini\u2019s bestiary, part of his encyclopaedic treatise, Li livres\ndou tr\u00e9sor, as the main concern here should be considered in the light of its large\naudience and popularity: the treatise, purposefully written in vernacular, was\nwidely disseminated and achieved a considerable posterity.\nThe brief description of the context is meant to offer the picture of the\ncultural circumstance to which the medieval encyclopaedia and the bestiary\nbelong. The main interest is focused on aspects concerning the tradition in\nwhich the natural history discourse is rooted, as well as on its contemporary ac-\ncommodation. There follows the description of Latini\u2019s bestiary\u2014a philological\napproach to the text, trying to determine the historical background of the\n303Abstracts\nsources it drew from, with a special emphasis on its peculiarity as one of the\nfew vernacular encyclopaedias. The main body of the study envisages the\nanalysis of the limit-transgression pattern, the basic mechanism that regulates\ncognition, and its elaborate medieval developments as a coherent and polarised\nChristian interpretation of the world. Thus, the present exercise is an attempt to\nshed light on the bestiary from the opposite side, and reveal the man within the\nbeast in the medieval treatise of animal history. We relate to the source not\nfrom the traditional hermeneutic attempt, prone to regard the bestiary as an\nallegory of the world; taking a step backwards, and tracing the sequence of the\ncognitive mechanism, the medieval bestiary appears as an allegory of the\nmedieval mind that thinks of it.\nInteractions between Muslims and Christians in Syria\nunder the Umayyad Caliphate, AD 661\u2013750\nRaisa Khamitova (Russian Federation)\nThesis Supervisor: Andrew Palmer\nExternal Reader: Garth Fowden (National Research Foundation, KERA, Athens)\nOne of the most important aspects of early Muslim rule was, as noted by the\nNorth Mesopotamian monk John bar Penkaye in the 680s, the fact that \u201cthere\nwas no distinction between pagan and Christian; the believer was not known\nfrom a Jew.\u201d This initial indifference of the Muslims to divisions among the\npeople whom they conquered, when compounded with the elimination of\ninternal borders across a huge area extending from northwest Africa to India,\nmeant that there was considerable human interaction across social, ethnic and\nreligious lines. In addition, there were the widespread phenomena of con-\nversion and apostasy, of inter-confessional marriage and festival attendance, of\ncommercial contacts, and of public debate, all of which promoted the circu-\nlation of ideas and information. It is, therefore, particularly important to study\nthe history of the seventh- and eighth-century Middle East as one of symbiosis\nand exchange between the communities, their religions and cultures.\nThe essential point that I make is that there was a pragmatic symbiosis in\nSyria in the early years of the Umayyad Caliphate. Drawing upon the estab-\nlished infrastructure of the Byzantine Middle East, the Muslim conquerors\nmade use of the extant administrative system (using Greek as the language of\nadministration). They also temporarily laid aside their scruples about the use of\nimages, adopted a Byzantine system of coinage bearing representations of the\ncaliphs, shared sacred spaces with Christians (as in the examples of the Dome\n304Abstracts\nof the Rock in Jerusalem, the Great Mosque of Damascus and the mosque at\nRusafa), and even engaged in a Middle Eastern variant of disputatio with\nChristian scholars on Trinitarian and Christological matters. This period was\nshort-lived; the \u2018Abbasids were less tolerant of religious diversity, and less\namenable to the survival of pre-conquest customs. It is all the more important,\nthen, that a study be made of this period, to ascertain whether it laid any\nfoundation which made co-existence possible in the more troubled times ahead.\nThe research presented here is based on the study of the following\nprimary sources: selected cultic buildings and their inscriptions, Byzantine and\nArabic coinage, and Arabic, Syriac and Greek literary disputes (in English trans-\nlations). Among the themes to be examined are Muslim appreciation of\nChristian holiness, the nature of Muslim oppression of Christians, shared places\nof prayer, and the Eastern Christian contribution to the formation of the\nIslamic empire.\nThe conclusion I reach is that interaction between Muslims and Christians\nin Syria in this period had a double character. Muslim dependence on the\nChristian population was stronger, at the outset, than we might expect of\npowerful conquerors; but then they had moved out of their own environment\nand into the highly developed culture of others, who were skilled in all the\npolitical and urban arts, from administration to architecture. On the other side\nof the exchange, the classical Islamic system and the new status it accorded to\nnon-Muslims brought about a considerable improvement in the formal and\nlegal status of these communities in their respective countries.\nThe Administration of a Byzantine Provincial City from the Sixth\nto the Eleventh Century on the Example of Cherson\nNikita Khrapunov (Ukraine)\nThesis Supervisors: Andrew Palmer, Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Werner Seibt (Universit\u00e4t Wien)\nThe purpose of the thesis is to sum up the results of previous studies and ex-\namine the development of the administration of Cherson during the Byzantine\nperiod against this background. Such a study will allow the following: answering\nsome minor questions connected to concrete administrative positions or pat-\nterns of Cherson\u2019s administrative machinery, and the formulation of some\ngeneral conclusions related to the reasons for and course of the administrative\nreforms in the Crimea, the continuity of the administration of Cherson, and the\nsimilarities and differences of the administration of Cherson and the principles\n305Abstracts\nof its development compared with those of other Byzantine provincial urban\ncentres.\nThis thesis consists of two major parts, a descriptive and an analytical. The\nfirst part includes three chapters corresponding to the three basic administrative\nsystems, which replaced one another in Cherson during the Byzantine period:\nthe doukate, the archontate, and the theme. The second part of the study is\nincluded in the fourth chapter, where the three basic aspects of the adminis-\ntrative history of Cherson\u2014the evolution, the continuity, and the general\nprinciple of development\u2014are analysed. In the appendix there is a study on the\nproblem of the city\u2019s change of name in the fifth and sixth centuries.\nAfter Justinian I (527\u2013565) had extended his possessions in the Crimea to\na considerable extant, a new province was established there. The government\nwas entrusted to a Byzantine military governor, titled the doux of Cherson. The\nweakening of Byzantium through the seventh century resulted in its territories\nin the Crimea being restricted to Cherson. By the eighth century, the archontate,\nthe administrative unit the staff of which combined their connection with the\nlocal community and recognition by Byzantium, had been established in\nCherson. During the reign of Theophilos (829\u2013842), the Empire annexed the\nKlimata in southwestern Crimea, and established there a theme with the capital\nin Cherson. The supreme power in the theme belonged to the general, strategos,\nwith a subordinate staff of officers including the officials of the municipality. In\nthe period between the late tenth and the mid-eleventh century, the themes of\nBosporos and Sougdaia were separated from this unit. The three Crimean themes\nwere united in the framework of a katepanate with the centre in Cherson. The\nlatest information on a Byzantine official in Cherson dates from the late\neleventh century.\nThe study of the administration of Cherson has allowed me to raise the\nquestion of the continuity of the administration of this city from its Late Classical\npredecessors. This continuity manifested itself in the preservation of some offices\nclosely connected with the community of Cherson. The nature of these offices\nchanged over the course of time, which made the succession of the\nadministrative machinery of Cherson during the given period a gradual transition.\nThe administrative development of Late Classical and medieval Cherson\ndepended on the political situation in the Crimea. A strengthening of the\nByzantine power on the peninsula resulted in enlarging the territory sub-\nordinated to it. A new province was established on the newly acquired territ-\nories, with the power concentrated in hands of the military governor appointed\nfrom Constantinople. A weakening of the Empire resulted in the restriction of\nthe Byzantine Crimea to the limits of the fortifications of Cherson, and the\nreinforcement of the elements of Cherson\u2019s self-government. The general\n306Abstracts\npattern of the development of the administration of the Byzantine Crimea was\nsimilar to that of the Balkans.\nThe Cult of St. Hyacinth and Polish Dominicans\nin Thirteenth-Century Cracow\nNelya Koteyko (Ukraine)\nThesis Supervisor: G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: Hanna Zaremska (Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw)\nThe subject of this analysis is the life and miracles of the Polish saint Hyacinth\nand the development of his posthumous cult in Cracow in the thirteenth\ncentury. His activities are set against the background of the activity of the\nDominican Order in the Polish province, where the saint played a key role.\nDuring his life he gained a reputation for being a missionary and preacher, but\nhis greatest achievement is considered to be the bringing of the first Domin-\nicans to Poland and the foundation of Dominican convents there. At the same\ntime, he was known as a great miracle worker and after his death the fame of\nhis miraculous power spread in Cracow and the surroundings.\nThis study focuses on the saint\u2019s \u201cdaily routine\u201d with its main saintly\nattribute of in vita and post mortem miracle working. This aspect of the saint\u2019s\nactivity is discussed in the context of the policy of the Dominican Order in\nPoland. Taking as a background his saintly activity in Cracow and its sur-\nroundings, based on his fourteenth-century biography, and other contemporary\nand later historical sources, we can define the circle of people interested in\ndeveloping the saint\u2019s cult and in promoting his canonisation.\nThe overview of the activity of the first Dominicans in Poland in the first\nchapter is followed by the discussion of the oldest biography of the saint\u2014De\nvita et miraculis written by the Dominican lector Stanislaw from the convent of\nthe Holy Trinity in Cracow. The main aim in the second chapter is to discuss\nthe historical value of the source, its composition, and authorship. The third\nchapter draws a historical sketch of the preparations undertaken by the Do-\nminicans to canonise the saint, and attempts to place St. Hyacinth\u2019s canonisa-\ntion in the larger context of the papal canonisation policy between the early\nthirteenth and the late fourteenth-century. This context is helpful for the un-\ncovering of possible reasons for the considerable delays and chronological\nbreaks in the course of preparations for the saint\u2019s canonisation.\nA detailed study of the texts of St. Hyacinth\u2019s miracles in the last two\nchapters reveals traces of intentional and spontaneous promotion of his cult.\n307Abstracts\nAdvice to turn to the saint for intercession came to an afflicted person both\nfrom the clerical and the lay circles of society. The traits of the intentions to\npromote St. Hyacinth\u2019s cult appear in public reports of a miracle received, in\nprivate story-telling about favours granted by the saint, and in visions of the\nsaint after his death, as well as in the case of the saint\u2019s apparition to a miracul\u00e9,\nwith careful instructions to visit his shrine and later inform people about the\nmiracle.\nThe Pecheneg Horse Bridle\nTeodora Kroumova (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky\nExternal Readers: Csan\u00e1d B\u00e1lint (Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Institute of\nArchaeology, Budapest); Mikl\u00f3s Tak\u00e1cs (Hungarian Academy of Sciences,\nInstitute of Archaeology, Budapest);\nAs a result of the close relationships between migratory peoples and the com-\nmon production centres that they used, a common fashion developed on the\nsouth-eastern European steppe. Despite considerable homogeneity, differences\nexisted, because of reasons involving style as a means of communicating\nindividuality or social identity. This factor allows the researcher to identify, to\nsome extent (and always cautiously), the provenance of certain objects with\ncertain ethnic groups.\nThis work is based on 230 rein mounts from Eastern and Central Europe,\nwhich can be provisionally attributed to the Pechenegs. It is based on those\nsimilarities and differences, the repetition of combinations that allows them to\nbe accepted as criteria for assembling, identifying, and interpreting the material\nassigned to the Pechenegs. These criteria form the basis of a classification\nsystem (visualised through a catalogue) to assist archaeologists in situating the\narchaeological material in time and space. Function, shape, and decoration were\nclosely connected, and only considering them together can give us clues for the\nprovisional ethnic identification of the objects in question.\nThe material itself and the goal of this study establish the methodology\napplied in the research. The basic method is the typological one and the related\nmethod of comparative analysis. They are accompanied by application of a\nmethodological approach for creating a cataloguing system and a full visual and\ntextual database of all the information related to the topic: general information\nabout the culture (including burial rites); maps and pictures; information about\nthe archaeological sites with detailed plans of the graves; and a glossary of\n308Abstracts\nterms. The rich searchable database allows those who are interested to do their\nown research through it and ask questions that I did not address.\nThe investigation of the material shows that Pecheneg material culture,\nwith reference to the bridle decoration, was original not in terms of the motifs\nused (as it borrowed elements from Byzantine, the steppe, and Sassanid art) but\nin terms of the specific combination of motifs and forms. The motifs were\nadopted in the course of trade contacts (the Silk Road) and contacts with the\nlarge production centres of the northern coastal region of the Black Sea, as well\nas through alliance relationships between Byzantium and nomadic peoples. The\ncombination of ornaments and patterns, however, is original and specific for\neach of them, and the steppe workshops producing for the nomadic aristocracy\nhad to conform to it. New data from the analysis of the material south of the\nLower Danube provides us with reasons to conclude the existence of a similar\nproduction centre in the territory serving the new nomadic aristocracy that\nsettled there. The concentration of finds there implies that a great number of\nnomads settled there after migrating from the steppe. The dispersal of the finds\nshows that another Pecheneg group continued and established itself in the\nCarpathian basin, without being, however, as compact and stable as those who\nsettled around the delta of the Danube.\nThe material presented in this MA thesis adds some notes to the history\nand archaeology of the Pecheneg migration, but still leaves some questions\nopen. To explore this field completely, one needs to supply the research with\nan extensive study of art and style, to follow the origin of motifs and influences\nback to the East and Byzantium.\nWith the collection of the material and its organisation in a typological\nsystem, as well as registering some of the tendencies in the Pecheneg artistic\nmetalwork, the present study is a good starting point for a detailed stylistic\nresearch in a broader historical context.\nImmortality and Immortal Knowledge:\nThe Vision of the Afterlife in the Third Book of Alfred\u2019s Soliloquies\nJurgita Kunsmanait\u0117 (Lithuania)\nThesis Supervisors: Andrew Palmer, Gy\u00f6rgy Ger\u00e9by, Katalin Hal\u00e1csy\nExternal Reader: Paul Szarmach (Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo)\nWhen Alfred the Great of Wessex translated St. Augustine\u2019s Soliloquies, one of\nhis least-studied works (at least now, and very probably in Alfred\u2019s time), it gave\nthe king the opportunity to show himself not only to be a competent translator\n309Abstracts\nand interpreter, and judicious compilator of ideas not present in Augustine\u2019s\nwork but current in the milieu of ninth-century north-west Europe, but also to\nbe a skilled writer, and even theorist, in his own right. Consequently, this thesis\naims to reveal these particular features of Alfred\u2019s writing. The work is vast, and\nso we have chosen to address two themes, closely linked eschatologically, which\nAlfred certainly takes from Augustine but develops independently: the immor-\ntality of knowledge and the status of the dead in the afterlife.\nThe method chosen for this purpose is a close textual analysis of the\nwork. First I present an analysis of the ideas present in Books I and II. Here we\nfind a straightforward, although increasingly free, translation of Augustine,\nwhich in the middle of Book II becomes an independent composition, and\nreturns to the ideas of Augustine only at the very end of this book. Then I\nproceed to the conclusion in Book III (Alfred\u2019s own work, or so it would\nappear), to show the connection of Book III with the rest of the work, and to\nsee how Alfred changes and amplifies Augustine\u2019s thought; then, an even closer\nanalysis of Book III, to discern the sources and influences which may have led\nAlfred to his individual position.\nThe introduction of the thesis addresses the problems of evaluating and\nanalysing the Old English Soliloquies, discusses the work in the general intellec-\ntual context of ninth-century England, and shows how it compares to other\nworks by Alfred. The first chapter briefly summarises the main argument of the\nLatin and the Old English Soliloquies, discusses the problems of the manuscript\nand editions, reviews sources probably used by Alfred and presents a short\ndescription of Alfred\u2019s method of \u201ctranslation\u201d or \u201ctransformation.\u201d The\nsecond chapter is dedicated to the analysis of the immortality of knowledge and\nthe way to God as presented in Books I and II. It consists of three main parts,\nwhich discuss knowledge in this life, in a (putative) pre-existence and in the\nafterlife. Alfred reaches the conclusion, like Augustine before him, but for\nrather different reasons, that knowledge is immortal. In Books I and II Alfred\ndoes not depart substantially from Augustine\u2019s argument, but he changes it so\nthat it leads logically to Book III. The third chapter concentrates on the picture\nof the afterlife as presented in Book III. Here one can see that Alfred formu-\nlates his own argument\u2014albeit with the help of other sources\u2014and he brings\nin a completely new theme, which was not discussed by Augustine at all: be-\nsides the vision of God and the immortal knowledge, he explains the different\nstatus accorded to the blessed and the damned in the afterlife, with particular\nreference to their respective knowledge and the modes of that knowledge\n(whether of their own fate, the fate of others, or of God).\nHopefully, this analysis of the Soliloquies will go some way towards con-\nfirming Alfred\u2019s reputation as a qualified interpreter and composer. Alfred man-\n310Abstracts\naged to handle a difficult philosophical work and, by turning it into a more\ntheological one, to alter and amplify Augustine\u2019s thoughts in such a way that it\nallowed him to pursue the argument to answer his own concerns\u2014and perhaps\neven those closer to him in time and geographical or cultural location than\nAugustine.\nHoly Fools in the South Slavonic Medieval Tradition\nNadejda Lazarova (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisors: Istv\u00e1n Perczel, G\u00e1bor Klaniczay, Elissaveta Moussakova\nExternal Reader: Heinz Miklas (Universit\u00e4t Wien)\nNo abstract available.\nConstrvi et erigi ivssit rex Collomannvs:\nThe Royal Chapel of King Coloman in the Complex of St. Mary in Zadar\nAna Marinkovi\u0107 (Croatia)\nThesis Supervisor: B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs\nExternal Reader: Mikl\u00f3s Tak\u00e1cs (Hungarian Academy of Sciences,\nInstitute of Archaeology)\n\u201cContent,\u201d that is, function and symbolic significance, was the most character-\nistic element of architecture for the medieval mind, so it is precisely in this\ncontent that one should look for the reason for erecting a certain building in a\ncertain form in a certain place. This is especially visible in the example of royal\nfoundations, because they featured the highest level of representation.\nThe ensemble of the bell tower and the chapter house of the monastery of\nSt. Mary in Zadar, built by the Hungarian King Coloman after his conquest of\nDalmatia in 1105, introduced innovative and highly elaborated features (such as\ncross-ribbed vaulting, heart-shaped palmette friezes, and cubic capitals), which\ncannot be considered results of any previous local development of Dalmatian\narchitecture. These forms have been discussed in the scholarship to some\nextent, but have never been put in the context of their function. By gathering\ndifferent types of sources in order to answer these questions, and, in addition,\nby completing the detailed description of the architectural ensemble, its carv-\nings and the unpublished analogies, in this thesis all the available relevant data\n311Abstracts\nfor the problem of Coloman\u2019s architecture in Zadar have been put together for\nthe first time.\nIn the first chapter, analysis of the spatial organisation of the ensemble\n(the form of the axial tower with the western gallery) in the light of these\nsources (such as the iconography of the fresco cycle connected to royal laudes,\nand written sources on Coloman\u2019s presence in Zadar and his palace) leads to\nthe conclusion that the ensemble was built as the royal chapel of King\nColoman. In the second chapter the spreading of the form both to and from\nZadar is discussed: the form was determined by its function in terms of the\nsymbolic importance it had for its contemporaries. As the consequence of\nreconsidering the sources from this new aspect, in the course of the research\nmany questions have been opened.\nIn this sense, the provenance of the workshop working at St. Mary\u2019s has\nbeen connected to the \u201cContarinian\u201d phase of St. Mark\u2019s in Venice (1063\u2013\n1094), while the further diffusion of the motifs was stimulated by the extension\nof the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Zadar in 1154. The comprehensive list of\nseveral architectural motifs, which spread to Dalmatia from Zadar, has been\nprovided as the basis for establishing their chronological order and causal rela-\ntionships. A certain connection with the Hungarian material from Sz\u00e9kes-\nfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r has been established as a direction for further research, and a finding\nfrom a probable estate of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty in continental Croatia has been\noffered as the mediator, given its location. As far as the spatial organisation is\nconcerned, the question of direct provenance has remained open, although its\ngeneral origins in the Byzantine and Carolingian royal chapels can be discerned\nin the scheme of the western gallery as the royal space. Further study of the\nanalogies in Hungary as well as in Croatia and Dalmatia could offer the answer\nto this question.\nFinally, both function and form are put in their historical context: the\nmotives for Coloman choosing St. Mary as his seat in Dalmatia have been\nfound in the traditional connections of the monastery with the kings of Croatia.\nThus, the result of the research is not only an explanation of the appearance of\na new style and the spreading of the forms, but also an attempt to analyse\nColoman\u2019s rule in Zadar from the aspect of its architectural consequences.\n312Abstracts\nNicholas of Dresden\u2019s Apologia: Revision and Codicological Analysis\nPetra Mutlov\u00e1 (Czech Republic)\nThesis Supervisors: Marcell Seb\u0151k, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Veszpr\u00e9my\nExternal Reader: John Klassen (Trinity Western University)\nThe aim of this thesis is to prepare a revision of a tract from the beginning of\nthe fifteenth century, written by the German preacher and lawyer Nicholas of\nDresden. Its title is De conclusionibus doctorum in Constancia de materia sanguinis,\noften also called the Apologia pro communione plebis sub utraque specie, which was\ncomposed as a response to the prohibition of the lay chalice by the Council of\nConstance in 1415. This tract was formerly accessible in the third volume of\nHermann von der Hardt\u2019s Magnum oecumenicum Constantiense concilium of 1698,\nwhich was based on as yet unidentified manuscripts from Leipzig, and was\nwidely used by scholars. Since it is fairly outdated nowadays, the goal of this\nstudy is to prepare a transcription of the second part of Nicholas\u2019 text, and\nidentify the quotations of the authorities that appear there, which will serve as a\nbasis for a later critical edition.\nLittle is known about Nicholas\u2019 personal history; therefore, the introduct-\nory part of this paper intends to place him within the context of the Hussite\nmilieu in the early fifteenth century. It outlines Nicholas\u2019 life, based on the facts\nthat are known about him at present. This part consists only of very basic\ninformation that could be gleaned from the accounts concerning his biography.\nCertain aspects of Nicholas\u2019 doctrine are illustrated as the next step. The discus-\nsions concerning the role Nicholas played in introducing Utraquist practice in\nBohemia are also outlined. In addition, the opinions of scholars who were\ndealing with Nicholas and drew conclusions concerning Nicholas\u2019 teaching are\ndemonstrated. This part is closed by an overview of Nicholas\u2019 Utraquistic\ntreatises.\nThe second part deals with the extant manuscripts of the Apologia. I exam-\nined the catalogues available in the archives and libraries in the Czech Republic,\nand to some extent those in Austria, and located eight manuscripts of this tract.\nHaving basically checked them, I could prepare a working collation of a chosen\npart of the Apologia, which as a result allows for the choice of manuscript\nMk 102 for the current transcription. In addition, I also present the manu-\nscripts from the Czech Republic, describing them in more detail. In sum, this\npart justifies the need for a revision of the older publication by Hardt and\noffers reasons for carrying out the preparatory examination on one particular\nmanuscript.\n313Abstracts\nThe core part of this thesis follows, which is the transcription of the se-\ncond part of the Apologia based on the manuscript Mk 102. It contains a preface\npresenting the rules and conventions used throughout the transcription, the\ntranscription itself, and an index of the authorities quoted in the Apologia. The\ntranscription conveys the text of the manuscript Mk 102, as is explained,\nwithout any attempt to emend it in terms of its sense or grammatical accuracy.\nIn the apparatus, the authorities that appear in the text are, as far as possible,\nidentified. It also indicates the passages similarly quoted in the other two\nUtraquistic treatises of Nicholas, namely Nisi manducaveritis and Contra Gallum.\nThe last part of this thesis summarises the contents of the Apologia, con-\ncentrating on the line of its argumentation. Moreover, I also comment on the\nauthorities cited in the Apologia, with a focus on their usage in the two afore-\nmentioned treatises of Nicholas. Since a large analysis would be too extensive\nfor this purpose, I demonstrate, using certain examples, what sort of compar-\nison can be undertaken, with indication of the possible results.\nIn the conclusion, the outcome of this research is outlined, namely the\nneed for a critical edition of the Apologia by Nicholas of Dresden. To a certain\nextent, the most suitable approach for the collation of the extant manuscripts\nof the Apologia is indicated. The examination of the authorities quoted here\npoints to many considerable implications, and results that could be obtained\nfrom a deeper analysis based on further research.\nVidere sine speculo.\nThe Immediate Vision of God in Richard of St. Victor\nCsaba N\u00e9meth (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: Gy\u00f6rgy Ger\u00e9by, Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: I. Van t\u2019 Spijker (Albertus-Magnus-Institut, K\u00f6ln)\nThe aim of this thesis is to investigate the concept of the facie ad faciem vision of\nGod\u2014the \u201cface to face\u201d vision\u2014in the works of Richard of St. Victor (d.\n1173). In the Augustinian theology generally accepted in the twelfth century,\nthe facie ad faciem vision of God was a reward reserved exclusively for the\nblessed, as opposed to the per speculum\u2014\u201cin a glass\u201d or \u201cthrough a mirror\u201d\u2014\nvision of the earthly life. Richard states in certain passages that the contemplat-\nives see God facie ad faciem, in other passages that they see Him quasi facie ad\nfaciem. The literature, reading the same few passages of Richard verbatim,\nadmits or denies that he taught the facie ad faciem vision in the contemplation.\nThe thesis tries to answer this question, putting it into a broader context of\n314Abstracts\nRichard\u2019s other spiritual works and Hugh of St. Victor\u2019s writing, and by means\nof comparative textual analysis.\nIn Chapter 1, I investigate Hugh of St. Victor\u2019s epistemology and its\nconnecting points to Richard\u2019s theology, and find that the teaching about\nAdam\u2019s immediate knowledge of God and its epistemological conditions is\nRichard\u2019s most important inheritance from Hugh. Chapter 2 summarises the\ncontemplative teachings of the Benjamin major, a work which used to serve\nmainly as a basis for the contradictory interpretations. Having outlined the\ndifferent interpretations, I investigate the usually consulted passages, conclud-\ning that none of them states explicitly the \u201cface to face\u201d vision in the contem-\nplation. I show how Richard transformed Hugh\u2019s theory on the prelapsarian\nAdam into an epistemological-anthropological teaching about postlapsarian\nmen, which enables the immediate vision of God in the earthly life. Conclud-\ning, I point out the recurrent phenomenon of Benjamin major that in the descrip-\ntions of contemplation, a certain simple light of truth always occurs, which the\ncontemplative sees. In Chapter 3, I extend the research to the works written\nbefore Benjamin major. In these works can be found descriptions of contempla-\ntion as \u201cface to face\u201d and \u201cquasi-face to face\u201d vision, but always described as a\nvision of light. In these works I find the well-defined teaching of speculatio,\ncontinuously present in works before the Benjamin major and reinterpreted in\nBenjamin major. Comparing the texts which describe the doctrine of speculatio,\nwith Richard\u2019s commentary on Revelation, I conclude that the terms \u201cquasi-\nface to face\u201d and \u201cface to face\u201d are in Richard synonyms, being for him only\nsimilitudines marking contemplation as an indirect vision of the divine light,\nwithout the usual eschatological connotations of the Augustinian theology. In\nChapter 4, I show that the illuminating light seen in contemplation is Christ as\nthe illuminating Wisdom of the Father. Then I compare the Victorine teaching\nwith certain anthropological teachings of Aquinas and Bonaventure. The\nthirteenth century rejected the Victorine anthropology, so it had only a\ntraditional Augustinian \u201canthropological pessimism and epistemological\noptimism\u201d (in the words of Istv\u00e1n Perczel), with the addition of the lumen gloriae\nand per essentiam vision. The rejected Victorine anthropology suggested anthro-\npological optimism together with epistemological optimism.\nThe main results of my thesis are that both Richard and Hugh of St.\nVictor were two authors who\u2014due to Hugh\u2019s epistemological doctrine\u2014gave\na radical and optimistic reinterpretation of Augustine. Richard was a much\nmore faithful follower of Hugh than we had previously thought, basing his\nanthropology and epistemology and spiritual teachings on Hugh\u2019s theology.\nFollowing this theology and a Victorine interpretation of the Areopagite, for\nRichard the term facie ad faciem does not have the usual Augustinian\n315Abstracts\neschatological meaning, but, rather, means the immediate vision of God. This\nteaching is Richard\u2019s answer and parallel to Hugh\u2019s teaching about Adam.\nThe Construction of Space in St. Euthymius\u2019 Vita of St. John of Rila\nEkaterina Pantcheva (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisor: Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Predrag Mateji\u010d (Resource Center for Medieval Slavic Studies,\nOhio State University, Hilandar Research Library)\nThe thesis offered here focuses on the problem of the construction of space in\na fourteenth-century Vita of St. John of Rila, namely the one by Euthymius the\nPatriarch of Turnovo. The reasons for the choice of this topic, as well as the\nimportance of the issue itself, are explained in the introductory part. In it some\nconceptual problems in terms of space, and in terms of the phenomenon of\nhesychasm are presented, together with the methodology and the aims of the\nstudy.\nThe first chapter aims at presenting the cultural context of the Vita,\nnamely Bulgarian cultural life in the fourteenth century, with priority given to\nthe time of Tsar John Alexander, looked at through the prism of the previous\nscholarship. The main emphasis is on the interdependence of various cultural\nphenomena and their contemporaneous theological ones, as explicated in the\nmonastic movement of hesychasm. The chapter ends with an overview, giving\na possible explanation of the contradictions in both the object of investigation\nand the scholarship.\nThe second chapter is the central and most important part of the work. It\ninvestigates the construction of space in the text as a phenomenon resulting\nfrom patterns in artistic thought, rather than in philosophical terms. For the\npoints most elusive for the modern reader, references to other hesychast\nwritings provide a reasonable elucidation. This second chapter is actually a close\ntextual exploration of the Vita. The comparison between it and its most\nprobable sources has resulted in a useful graph.\nIn the conclusion, some possible issues for further investigation are\nsuggested.\nThe Appendix comprises an amended version of the latest edition of the\nZograph copy of the Vita, preceded by some notes on palaeography and\northography. Four images of the time, as well as a copy of the first page of the\nmanuscript, exemplify some points in the work.\n316Abstracts\nThe Originality of Romanos\nand his Debt to Earlier Poets who Described the Sacrifice of Isaac\nSvetlana Salovska (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisor: Andrew Palmer\nExternal Reader: David Taylor (University of Birmingham)\nRomanos (\u201cthe Melodist\u201d) is famous for his Greek kontakia, composed in the\nfirst half of the sixth century. The kontakion is a poem intended for perform-\nance in church, with a response after every stanza, which was sung by the con-\ngregation. It is often dramatic in form, with a subject taken from the Scripture.\nThe speeches attributed to Biblical characters may have been performed by\ncantors who acted the part of those characters. This type of static liturgical\ndrama may have been imitated from the Syrians. A close examination of one of\nthe kontakia by Romanos, that on the Sacrifice of Isaac (the acrostic title is \u201cA\nHymn on Abraham\u201d), leads to the following findings.\nThe literary form in which the poem is composed is modelled on the\nSyriac madrosho (especially the type of madrosho called sugitho), with additional\nfeatures borrowed from the Syriac mimro, and further additional features which\nare not of Syriac origin. The madrosho was perfected as a form in the fourth\ncentury by Ephrem of Nisibis, who often used it as a vehicle of dramatic\ndialogues; these dialogues may have been performed by two cantors, sometimes\nwith a third cantor as the narrator.\nEphrem brought a lively imagination and a high regard for women to the\nexegesis of Scripture; he dramatised the conflicting feelings of the Sinful\nWoman who came to Jesus, in a musical dialogue between this woman and\nSatan, for example. The influence of Ephrem on Syriac literature was immense;\nmany mimre which are not in fact by him were inspired by his genuine works\nand written in his favourite metre, and so have been transmitted as works of\nEphrem himself.\nTwo such mimre (here called Mimro I and Mimro II) are devoted to the\nSacrifice of Isaac; even though Mimro II depends on Mimro I in many respects,\nit prefers Ephrem\u2019s own positive assessment of the strength of character of\nSarah. Ephrem\u2019s evaluation of Sarah as no less faithful than Abraham is found\nin his Commentary on Genesis, XX; it seems to be made in answer to another com-\nmentator, who said (as Mimro I does) that Sarah would have tried to stop the\nSacrifice of Isaac.\nSome of Ephrem\u2019s poetry was translated into Greek; more often, Greek\ncompositions imitated his metre and his way of writing about the characters in\nthe Bible. One such Greek \u201cEphremic\u201d poem on the Sacrifice of Isaac takes\n317Abstracts\nthe same line as Mimro I. Romanos seems to have known this Greek poem,\nwhich perhaps was already used by Gregory of Nyssa ca. 383; verbal echoes of\n\u201cEphrem Graecus\u201d can be found here and there in the \u201cHymn on Abraham\u201d\nby Romanos.\nRomanos also seems to have known the two Syriac mimre on the Sacrifice\nof Isaac; at any rate, he adopts motifs and ideas which are not attested else-\nwhere in the extant Christian literature, though some of them are found in\nJewish haggadic exegesis. As a native of Emesa in Syria, a bilingual city where\nSyriac and Greek were both spoken, and as the son of Jewish parents (accord-\ning to a kontakion composed in his honour), Romanos may well have had access\nto Syriac and Jewish sources.\nThe \u201cHymn on Abraham\u201d is unique, even among the works of Romanos,\nin creating a doubly unreal situation (a hypothetical speech within a hypo-\nthetical speech), then merging this situation with one in which a real character\nanswers an unreal one. This \u201cconjuring trick\u201d could very well have been\naccomplished by having one and the same cantor act the parts of the\nhypothetical Abraham and the real Abraham and speak to another cantor who\nacted the parts of both the unreal and the real Sarah. By means of this sleight of\nhand, Romanos is able to find a place in his kontakion for both Sarahs, the Sarah\nwho would have opposed the Sacrifice of Isaac (Ephrem Graecus; Mimro I) and\nthe Sarah who would have supported it (Ephrem; Mimro II).\nThe originality of Romanos is thus seen to be partly the product of his\ndetermination to be true to the traditions on which he drew; far from making\nhis work merely derivative, this respect for tradition forced him to invent a\nnovel dramatic device.\nThe thesis contains the following translations in addition to the argumen-\ntation. Appendix I: Genesis 22, in a new English translation from the Greek;\nAppendix II: the poem by Ephrem Graecus, in a new English translation;\nAppendix III: the kontakion of Romanos, in a new English translation.\nTransformations in the Settlement Structure in the Territory Between the\nDanube and Tisza Rivers: Monostor\u2014a Case Study\nEdit Bel\u00e9nyesyn\u00e9 S\u00e1rosi (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky\nExternal Reader: Beatrix Romh\u00e1nyi (ELTE, Dept. of Archaeology, Budapest)\nThis thesis aims to complete the complex medieval topography of a specially\nchosen micro-region, namely the Monostor estate, in the central part of the\n318Abstracts\nDanube Tisza Interfluve region, in the western part of a large geographical unit,\nnamely the Kiskuns\u00e1g Loess Plain. The territory appears as an administrative\nunit from its earliest depictions on maps, and it can be supposed that this estate\ncan be more or less identical with the possessio Monostor mentioned by medieval,\nearly modern and modern sources. Through this, a well-definable area was\nchosen, one which can be taken at the same time as a geographical micro-\nregion.\nThis area is not a favourable topic for investigations of settlement struc-\nture of medieval Hungary. Although problems of topography have been studied\nin scholarship for over one hundred years, the modern, interdisciplinary topo-\ngraphy of this territory has never been made. Regional studies have been\npublished about this part of the country, but mainly focusing on historical\nquestions. More archaeological research was carried out by K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Szab\u00f3 in\nthe 1930s, but thereafter hardly any investigations of this kind can be men-\ntioned, except for rescue excavations. Even the large scale archaeological-\ntopographical project, the Archaeological Topography of Hungary (Magyarorsz\u00e1g\nR\u00e9g\u00e9szeti Topogr\u00e1fi\u00e1ja) did not reach the region. The studied micro-region was\nselected upon two basic criteria. It has twofold importance concerning topo-\ngraphy: the work aims at discussing the scholarly debate around the kindred\nmonastery of P\u00e9termonostor and P\u00e1lmonostora. It was a very important task for the\nstudy to solve the problem of whether there were two monasteries in close\nvicinity, or whether, as seemed to be more likely, that only one monastery\nexisted there, which might have been devoted to both St. Peter and St. Paul.\nThis area was chosen to be a sample area for a basic study, to show by what\nmeans and by what methods a topographical research can bring results. At the\nsame time, the territory was used to exemplify how and what kind of methods\nwork there, in what forms and to what extent they can be used. The thesis\ncould not undertake to complete and detailed history of the whole region\nbasing on contemporary sources, but the investigation tried to collect and apply\nall the available methods on the chosen micro-region to outline its historical\ntopography. Basically three types of information were used: data from contem-\nporary historical sources, analysis of maps, and archaeological information. For\nlack of written documents, special stress was put on archaeological methods,\nsuch as fieldwork and interpreting aerial photos.\nThe research yielded the identification of several traces of medieval settle-\nments in the study area. Archaeological fieldwalking showed that in this part of\nthe country, conditions of natural endowment not only influence, but deter-\nmine, the place of the settlements as well as the road structure among them.\nThe research suggests that over the centuries the places suitable for living were\nsituated 102.5m above sea level. This elevation probably shows the level of\n319Abstracts\ntemporary bodies of water; even in the Modern period farmsteads were built\nabove this height. Archaeological material of more periods was found, namely\nprehistory, the Roman period (Sarmatian), the Arpadian age and the late\nmedieval periods. Traces of settlement had three major cores in the area. Two\nvillages were located in the area: the settlement of Als\u00f3monostor probably existed\nup to the mid-fourteenth century, while the village of Fels\u0151monostor was probably\nthe more important micro-centre of the territory; according to archaeological\nmaterial found at the site this place was inhabited throughout the Middle Ages.\nAlso the parish churches of both villages were identified.\nAlthough contemporary sources mention separately the names of\nP\u00e9termonostora and P\u00e1lmonostora, there is a strong debate whether two or only one\nmonastery existed in the area. After collecting available comparative material it\ncan only be presumed, not stated, that in the Arpadian age in Csongr\u00e1d County\nthere was only one monastery founded by the Becse-Gergely kindred, which was\ndevoted to SS. Peter and Paul. For some unknown reason the full title of the\nmonastery does not appear in the sources. The study showed that both church\nruins depicted on historical maps were rather parish churches of villages;\nneither of them can be identified with the church of the monastery at this stage\nof research, as had been presumed in previous scholarly literature. Finally, after\ndetailed and comparative analysis of available sources, maps and archaeological\nmaterial the location of the monastery is still unknown. Nevertheless, further\ninvestigations and fieldwalk surveys may destroy or support this theory, but\nuntil the appearance and identification of ruins, the problem of location cannot\nbe solved, and the possibility that two monasteries existed separately cannot be\nprecluded.\nIn conclusion, the results of the research justified the hypothesis that\nthrough complex and detailed analysis of available sources, not only can the\nhistorical settlement structure and its transformations be outlined for a territory\nwithout written sources concerning settlements, but also other aspects, such as\nthe medieval road structure and historical conditions of nature, can be studied.\nFinally, although several questions were left open in connection with the\nmonastery, the research made clear that the applied methods can be used, and\nare worth using, in the chosen micro-region.\n320Abstracts\nCosmas Indicopleustes: Caught between Alexandria and Antioch\nMatthew J. Suff (United Kingdom)\nThesis Supervisor: Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Theresia Hainthaller (Philosophiche-Theologische Hochschule\nSankt Georgen, Frankfurt)\nAlmost everything concerning the life of the sixth-century sea-faring merchant\nturned monk and amateur theologian, Cosmas of Alexandria, erroneously\nsurnamed \u201cIndicopleustes\u201d (\u201cthe Indian Navigator\u201d), is unknown. His very\nname has been disputed, as has his place of origin. All that scholars have to go\non are his few extant works\u2014and apart from a few exegetical fragments, there\nis only his magnum opus, the Topographia Christiana, an extraordinary work which\ncombines reports on geography (often derived from first-hand experience) with\ntheological speculation.\nThe Topographia has often been taken as a work of (pseudo-)science, rather\nthan theology per se, since it appears that its primary purpose is one of re-\nfutation: refutation of theories current in Alexandria at the time, derived from\nHellenic (which is say, pagan) thought concerning the shape of the earth and its\nplace in the universe. There is much criticism of \u201cpretended Christians\u201d and\nheretics of various persuasions, and Cosmas\u2019 tone is often mordant, even sar-\ncastic. However, there is an even more intriguing apologia to be read between\nthe lines: that of crypto-Nestorianism in a Monophysite (or at least Neo-\nChalcedonian) milieu.\nThe extent of Cosmas\u2019 Dyophysitism has been much debated. Nowhere\nin the work, which cites much from Scripture, but also from various Church\nFathers and authorities, is Theodore of Mopsuestia mentioned. However,\nneither is St. Cyril of Alexandria. There are fulsome thanks given to Cosmas\u2019\nteacher, a certain Mar Aba from the Nestorian School of Nisibis, and this is\none hint as to Cosmas\u2019 affiliation. Yet there are better clues to be found in the\nexegetical arguments within the work\nCosmas takes from Theodore the idea of \u201ctwo catastases,\u201d two conditions,\nto be understood in both a spatial sense (earth and heaven) and a temporal one\n(life here and now, and after death and salvation). His soteriology is rooted in\nan anthropocentric view of the universe and God\u2019s Divine Economy. Earthly\nlife is to be seen as a process of instruction, with death part of that process of\nperfecting mankind.\nAs to the nature of the Saviour, Cosmas is circumspect. Nowhere is there\nany mention of \u201cTwo Natures\u201d\u2014indeed Cosmas shies away from the word\nphysis unless speaking on scientific matters, or on the nature of mankind, or\u2014\n321Abstracts\nimportantly\u2014when quoting others (none of them Dyophysite) on Christ\u2019s\nnature, perhaps as an argumentum a fortiori. Instead, abstract nouns, humanity and\nDivinity, are employed. Hypostasis, prosopon, and ousia are all likewise used in\ninnocuous contexts or in digressions on the Trinity, never in a Christological\nsense. There is, however, an emphasis on Christ\u2019s humanity, rather than His\nDivinity, and a marked preference for the Antiochene synapheia instead of henosis\nwhen writing of any kind of union\u2014and when henosis is used, it is the exairetos\nhenosis of Theodore of Mopsuestia. Theodore\u2019s conception of \u201cin-dwelling\u201d is\nnot used, but metaphors of clothing (very much in the Syriac tradition) are: the\nhomo assumptus is indeed to be assumed, in these passages. And Christ is shown\nas fatherless according to the flesh and motherless according to the Divinity:\nthe word Theotokos, entirely Chalcedonian and entirely Orthodox, is nowhere to\nbe found. Mary is always the Virgin, nothing more.\nThis thesis attempts to tease out some of the stands of Dyophysitism\npresent in Cosmas\u2019 Topographia, primarily concentrating on Books II, V, and X,\nwhere the bulk of his Christological and soteriological speculations are to be\nfound in their clearest form. It draws upon the previous work on Cosmas by\nWanda Wolska-Conus, and to a lesser extent certain articles by Grillmeier and\nHainthaler, Gray, and Brock. The conclusion reached is tentative\u2014Cosmas is\nseen as immensely cautious, even sly, in what he permits himself to say. His\nChristology appears to be Dyophysite, but the evidence for this, although com-\npelling, is found only occasionally. Rather, it is an investigation into Cosmas\u2019\nsoteriology which shows him most clearly to be a follower of Theodore of\nMopsuestia, and a Nestorian from the Greek-speaking, rather than Syriac-\nspeaking, part of the Byzantine oikoumene, even after Zeno\u2019s Henoticon and just\nbefore Justinian\u2019s Condemnation of the Three Chapters.\nCosmas\u2019 work had little lasting influence in the West and was soon\nforgotten. In the Slavic world it retained some currency, although stripped of all\nDyophysite resonance. Thus at least Orthodoxy was not much disturbed. Yet\nthe neglect of a work of an independent mind, whose theories are individual\nand idiosyncratic (if not always original, except in the oddest details) is to be\nlamented.\n322Abstracts\nVe\u0107enega\u2019s Book of Hours:\nManuscript Study with a Special Stress on Decorated Initials\nRozana Vojvoda (Croatia)\nThesis Supervisor: B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs\nExternal Reader: T\u00fcnde Wehli (Hungarian Academy of Sciences,\nInstitute of Art History, Budapest)\nThis thesis deals with the eleventh-century manuscript preserved in the Library\nof the Hungarian Academy of Sciences as K.394. It attempts to grasp many of\nits aspects, and therefore an analysis of the source requires a combination of\napproaches. The basic categories for describing the manuscript are used as\nseparate chapters, revealing a rather complicated story about the provenance,\nthe possible ownership, and the usage of the manuscript. In these chapters,\ncodicological and some extent liturgical analyses are used, as are analyses of the\nprimary sources concerning the specific historical moment.\nA codicological description aims to present the actual current state of the\nmanuscript, while the chapters on the manuscript\u2019s provenance present\narguments revealing Zadar as its place of origin, and deal also with more\nnarrow provenance, namely the relation to the Benedictine monastery of St.\nMary in Zadar.\nOne of the most interesting things when we are faced with illuminated\nmanuscripts is the question of the ownership. There is a strong possibility that\nthe manuscript belonged to Ve\u0107enega, the abbess of the convent of St. Mary,\nand that she brought it with herself to the monastery. This is related to the\nfunction of the manuscript and the question of the genre, because it seems that\nthe manuscript is an early example of a Book of Hours. Therefore, the chapter\nthat deals with the provenance of the manuscript and the one that deals with\nthe genre are strongly interdependent.\nHowever, a special stress is placed on the decorated initials, and thus art-\nhistorical methods, such as description, comparison, and iconographical\nanalyses, are used. The aim is the creation of a complete description of all the\ninitials in the manuscript, their classification and placing into the context of the\nworkshop. The chapter which deals with the classification of the initials accord-\ning to the motifs also includes an attempt at ascertaining the text and image\nrelationship, and it serves to answer two questions: to what extent may we call\nthese illuminations functional, and can we connect the system of the illumina-\ntion with a genre of the manuscript? It also aims to stress that that the\ndepictions of animals differ substantially from the other manuscripts of the\n323Abstracts\nsame workshop, and this presents a first step in establishing Beneventan\nvariants of form and meaning when considering the depictions of animals.\nThis huge issue cannot, however, be treated in the range of an MA thesis.\nThe question of the workshop presupposes the existence of the scriptorium of\nSt. Mary, contrary to the accepted opinion that the manuscript is the work of\nthe scriptorium of St. Chrysogonus. Due to the importance of the question,\nwhich demands more extensive research, it is treated simply as a serious\npossibility that deserves further investigation.\n324",

It compiles the\nmural representations of the signs of the Zodiac, as part of the iconographic\nprogrammes of Orthodox churches in the Byzantine and post-Byzantine epoch.\nThe signs of the Zodiac are found in three different themes: as an illustration of\nPsalm 148, in the scene of Judgement Day and in the Menologion. In each case, in\nseparate chapters representative monuments are discussed. In the case of Psalm\n148, the analysis is focused on the fourteenth-century monastery of Lesnovo. In\nthe case of the representations of the signs of the Zodiac in the Judgement Day\nscenes and the Menologion, the analysis is based on a group of Moldavian\nmonasteries from the sixteenth century.\nThe analysis undertaken is an investigation of the possible iconographic\nsolutions that might have been the origin for such depictions. It features research\non the iconography of these scenes in preceding and contemporary monuments,\nbut also takes into consideration the background political and social factors.\nBeing a Chosen One: Self-Consciousness and Self-Fashioning in the\nWorks of Gerolamo Cardano\nD\u00f3ra Bobory (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: Marcell Seb\u0151k, G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: Marianna Birnbaum (UCLA)\nAlthough the romantic attitude of Burckhardt that viewed the Italian\nRenaissance as the revolt of particular individuals against the darkness of the\n293Abstracts\nmedieval heritage has been successfully criticised, there is no question that there\nwere important participants of the intellectual sphere (and certainly that of art)\nwho did not belong to philosophical schools or institutions. These \u201cnew\nintellectuals,\u201d the third generation of Humanists, were not necessarily supported\nby powerful patrons; rather, they were scholars who had to make their own way\nthrough the complex network of ideologies and traditions, following their own\npresentiments while utilising a great variety of sources and thoughts, which were\nnot always part of or rooted in the mainstream.\nThe \u201cnew intellectual\u201d had to be a conscious, determined businessman,\nwho knew how to sell his literary products, and shaped himself into whatever\nform was the most required. The matter of the ability to control one\u2019s own\nidentity played a decisive role in the person\u2019s further career: if one negotiated\nwell enough among the capricious market-forces, one was able to survive, or\neven to acquire fame and success, with all that those factors imply: wealth and\nrecognition in the scholarly world.\nSome of these scholars went further than simply embracing the\nopportunities: they really believed that they were meant to do more than fulfil\nthe requirements of the readers, but also to lead some kind of a mission. They\nfelt themselves initiated, chosen for knowing the secrets that others were not\nallowed or prepared or able to know.\nSince it is always easier to approach an epoch through the life and work of\na characteristic individual, this paper focuses on a very enigmatic and\ncontroversial figure of the Italian renaissance, one whose life and works reflect\nfaithfully the problems and difficulties a scholar in sixteenth-century Italy had to\nface. Such a one was Gerolamo Cardano, the Milanese polymath: through the\nanalysis of his efforts aiming at the creation of the image of himself as a chosen\none with special abilities, I show how the raw market-forces challenged him and\nhis fellow scholars to perform (or at least claim to do so) something outstanding\nand often astonishingly bold in the scientific world.\nThe sources of this research were of two different kinds: on the one hand I\nfocused on his De propria vita, which I consider the non-scientific formulation of\nthe author\u2019s ideas and which is full of miraculous stories all accentuating\nCardano\u2019s centrality in his microcosmos, while on the other I tried to find the\npassages in the scientific corpus that testify to the argument that he consciously\ncreated an image of himself as a chosen one, using his own works as a means\nfor that purpose.\n294Abstracts\nStephen the Great through His Letters:\nBuilding an Image for Europe\nElena Cartaleanu (Moldova)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00e1nos M. Bak\nExternal Reader: Maria Cr\u0103ciun (Institute of History, Cluj-Napoca)\nStephen the Great (1457\u20131504) was one of the most important figures of\nMoldavian history. During his rulership he succeeded in promoting Moldavia on\nthe international arena, due to its position as the \u201cshield of Christendom.\u201d In\norder to establish contacts and to fulfil his strategic goals, Stephen built, through\nhis letters and embassies to the foreign monarchs, a multi-sided image, which he\nused according to the circumstances.\nThe image was a complex one, which varied according to the status of the\naddressee. In his relationship with neighbours, such as the kings of Hungary and\nPoland and the grand duke of Lithuania, Stephen showed himself to be a good\ndiplomat, but a strict defender of his own realm. He pointed out that he\nprotected Poland and Lithuania from the pagans, but asked them to behave\nhonestly towards Moldavia. As a good Christian, he requested his \u201cbrethren in\nChrist\u201d not to quarrel in the face of the common danger from the infidels.\nIn his communication with distant Western rulers, Stephen stressed his\nimage as a crusader, that is, a good Christian and a prince. As a Christian, he\nshowed himself ready to fight against heathen enemies, with the help of his\naddressees. As a prince, he insisted on being treated as an equal, who had the\nright to participate in royal enterprises. The image was completed by reference\nto his heroic deeds as a warrior, and his successful dynastic policy.\nThis public representation of Stephen the Great was also partially reflected\nin his correspondence on private affairs, such as the Venetian campaign of\nrecruiting a doctor for the elderly and suffering voivode. In this less official\ncorrespondence Stephen allowed his image to look more personalised, but he\ninvoked again his public deeds\u2014the anti-Ottoman activity\u2014as his main\nargument, in order to convince the Venetians to help him.\nWhile only certain parts of Stephens\u2019 image were shown to the Western\nrulers, the voivode was also building a special representation for his own\nsubjects, and another one for the Orthodox world. Being a talented strategist,\nStephen the Great succeeded in making in every case a full and attractive\npicture.\n295Abstracts\nThe Prince in Sixteenth Century Moldavia and Wallachia Between\nRenaissance and Reformation\nRafael-Dorian Chelaru (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: Marcell Seb\u0151k\nExternal Reader: Maria Cr\u0103ciun (Institute of History, Cluj-Napoca)\nThe present research focuses on three figures of princes that ruled in sixteenth-\ncentury Moldavia and Wallachia. These rulers are the following: Petru Rare\u015f,\nprince of Moldavia (1527\u20131538; 1541\u20131546), Jacob Heraclides the Despot,\nprince of Moldavia (1561\u20131563) and Petru Cercel, prince of Wallachia (1583\u2013\n1585). There are two reasons why these princes are considered as case studies.\nThe first is that their personal religious affiliation is different: Petru Rare\u015f was\nOrthodox, Jacob Heraclides the Despot was Protestant (an adept of Socinian\nRadical Protestantism) and Petru Cercel was Catholic. The second reason is that\nall these princes were considered to illustrate Renaissance types of rulership by\nthe relevant Romanian historiography.\nThe two reasons constituted at the same time the main two motivations\nand guiding points of our work. This research has based its argument on two\nmain issues: the first is to discuss the concept of the Renaissance prince\ncorroborated with the realities of the period, and the second is to discuss the\nproblem of confessionalisation of the state. Consequently, this thesis aims to\nanswer two main questions: firstly, whether one can speak about a Renaissance\nrulership appearing in sixteenth-century Wallachia and Moldavia, and secondly,\nwhether one can speak about a confessionalisation of the state in this particular\nregion and period.\nThe first chapter contextualises the argument, namely by providing the\nreader with as concise as possible an overview on the three princes studied and\ntheir foreign policy. The discussion of this aspect of rulership stresses the\norganic link between the diplomatic initiatives of these rulers and the\ninternational political context of the period: nevertheless, the undoubted\ninfluence of the personal ambitions and decisions is to be an important issue in\nour discussion.\nThe second chapter discusses the problem of the existence and\nmanifestation of the Renaissance model of rulership concerning the three case\nstudies. The discussion is based on the concept of the Renaissance prince as it\nwas developed in the relevant Romanian scholarship, and analyses its validity in\ncorrelation with the relevant international scholarship. The argument follows the\nmain relevant aspects of rulership liable to bear Renaissance influences:\nlegitimacy, diplomacy, state administration and cultural initiatives.\n296Abstracts\nFinally, the last chapter discusses the influence of religion on these\nparticular rulerships. Within this frame, a special focus on a possible influence\nof the personal religious affiliation is put, as the three princes had different\nreligious backgrounds. The main question this final chapter tries to answer is\nwhether we can speak about an important influence of religion in various\naspects of rulership: the relation of the ruler with the \u201cofficial\u201d Church in the\nstate (in our case the Orthodox Church), the confessional policy of the ruler\n(attitudes of tolerance or intolerance towards the religious communities in the\nstate), the \u201cinternational\u201d relations of the ruler (either \u201cofficial\u201d or particular) in\norder to see whether religion constituted as a criterion of selection, and the\nrelation between religion and the cultural initiatives of the ruler.\nThe Building of the Moldavian\u2013Wallachian Frontier c. 1350\u2013c. 1450\nMarian Coman (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00e1nos M. Bak\nExternal Reader: N\u00f3ra Berend (St. Catherine\u2019s College, Cambridge)\nViewed simply as a frontier like all others in the medieval period, the\nWallachian\u2013Moldavian frontier is placed in an ambiguous position in modern\ntimes by national bias. Although it is still recognised as a historical frontier, it\nbecomes also, from a national perspective, a pseudo-frontier, since the\nWallachians and the Moldavians were regarded as part of the same nation. To\nsolve this contradiction between medieval reality and the modern interpretative\nframe, most Romanian scholars either simply refused to treat the topic or\nemphasised the extraordinary stability of the Wallachian-Moldavian frontier,\nunderlining its peaceful evolution. In my opinion their verdict was incorrect and\nideologically determined, and my thesis is a long overdue reconsideration of the\nproblem.\nBefore becoming a political issue, the settlement of a frontier is a matter of\nhuman geography; therefore, the first question to be raised is not where the\nfrontier was, but rather what its nature was. By analysing the demographic\nevolution from this time frame (c. 1350\u2013c. 1450) I argue that the borderland\nbetween Wallachia and Moldavia was, from a demographic point of view, an\nopen frontier. The previous population movements, especially with settlers\ncoming from Transylvania during the fourteenth century, did not affect the\nborderland areas. Settlers, among them certainly Wallachians, moved into this\nregion from the end of the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth\ncentury. To this demographic evolution there corresponds a specific political\n297Abstracts\nevolution. I was able to show that after the Golden Horde lost this region,\nsouth-western Moldavia and north-eastern Wallachia remained under the\ncontrol of local Tartar Lords for one or two decades. This persistence of Tartar\ncontrol manifested itself not only politically, but also in the demographic and\neconomic realities of the region, by delaying their development in rapport with\nthe other Wallachian and Moldavian regions. Therefore, my argument is that as\na steppe zone controlled by the Mongols for a longer period than the\nneighbouring areas, scarcely inhabited, not crossed by important trade routes,\nthe region had little to offer. According to my interpretation, the end of Mongol\ncontrol was followed in a first phase by the nominal extension of the two\nVoievods\u2019 authorities over southern Moldavia and north-eastern Wallachia. At\nthe same time the demographic growth in these regions coincided with the\nincreasing effectiveness of their authority. And, as the result of their encounter,\nthe frontier between the two principalities was established for the first time. I\nargue that Mircea was the voievod who used his position of protector of the\nMoldavian voievod, Alexander, for settling the Moldavian\u2013Wallachian frontier\nfor the first time, Wallachia taking the lion\u2019s share. The agreement was\nchallenged by the Moldavians when internal rivalries and the Ottoman\nincursions destabilised Wallachia. All the subsequent Wallachian attempts to\nchange back the frontier were unsuccessful, and this prolonged dispute was one\nof the main causes of the Moldavian\u2013Wallachian animosity during the fifteenth\ncentury. This building process of the concrete Wallachian\u2013Moldavian frontier\nwas doubled by the building of an imaginary frontier, difficult if not impossible\nto reconstruct due to the nature of the sources according to which the\nMoldavian and the Wallachian identities were constructed.\nThe Mendicants\u2019 Mission in an Orthodox Land:\nA Case Study of Moldavia (Thirteenth to Fifteenth Century)\nClaudia Dobre (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky, G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: \u015eerban Papacostea (Institute Nicolae Iorga, Bucharest)\nThe thesis deals with the activities and the missionary strategies of the\nMendicants in Moldavia from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century. The first\nchapter reviews their presence there and focuses mainly on the foundation and\nrefoundation of the bishopric of the Cumans. Nevertheless, it also takes into\naccount other aspects of the presence of the Mendicants, such as their activities\namong the Tartars. The second chapter is concerned with the missionary\n298Abstracts\nstrategies and activities of the Mendicants in Moldavia in this period of time.\nThe conversions of the rulers, the influence of the Mendicants at the court, and\nthe relations with the Orthodox are the most important issues of this chapter.\nThe third chapter deals with the Mendicant settlements in Moldavia. The spatial\nanalysis used in this chapter shows that they followed some specific strategies in\nchosing the locations of their settlements. They had friaries in localities with\nsome urban features, on commercial routes, and in the residence of local rulers,\nwhich were also the localities with communities of Saxons or Hungarians, who\nwere Catholics.\nThe conclusion is that their activities in Moldavia were closely related to\nthe support of the Polish and Hungarian kings, on the one hand, and with the\nMoldavian rulers\u2019 interest, on the other. Furthermore, the policy of the papacy\nhad a great impact on their presence and activity in Moldavia in this period of\ntime. Their mission in a frontier space, in a region where the majority of the\npopulation belonged to Orthodoxy, was different from, and more complex\nthan, missions in either a pagan space or within Western Christendom.\nSwords in Images: Representation, Development, and Message\n(Central Europe from the Fourteenth to the Sixteenth Century)\nGoda Giedraityte (Lithuania)\nThesis Supervisor: Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Thomas Richardson (Royal Armouries Museum, Leeds)\nResearch into sword iconography, the results of which are presented in this\nthesis, has revealed many intriguing insights and observations. The main goal of\nmy research was to analyze religious paintings from late medieval Central\nEurope that bear the representations of swords. Specifically I wanted to\ndiscover the development of these representations, and to ground it on\nexamples and patterns represented in images. A concomitant goal was to find\nout what hidden messages these representations bear.\nFor this reason I referred to the English scholar Ewart Oakeshott\u2019s\ntypology, and used it as an auxiliary device for understanding the whole picture\nof the swords\u2019 development and migration in Central Europe. Data yielded by\nthe research have revealed that besides the correspondence of swords\u2019\nrepresentations to the \u201creality\u201d of these weapons, a \u201crepetitive\u201d sword\u2019s image is\nalso a common phenomenon, especially in early codex illuminations.\nIn spite of this formal comparative analysis, it appears that the image of\nthe sword directly depends on the subject matter of the painting, as well as on\n299Abstracts\nthe message it proclaims. This helped to introduce such categories as sword as\nan attribute, sword in action, sword as a sign of everyday life, and so on. At the\nsame time, an intriguing interaction between Eastern and Western military\npractice can be observed when analyzing the appearance and frequency of\nswords\u2019 images in particular scenes.\nThis research was an attempt to expand the borders of arms history while\napplying iconographic analysis. Therefore it is certainly a subject of revision and\nelaboration.\nFleur-de-lis in Medieval Bosnia\nElma Ha\u0161imbegovi\u0107 (Bosnia)\nThesis Supervisors: Neven Budak, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Veszpr\u00e9my\nExternal Readers: Sima \u0106irkovi\u0107, (SANU, Belgrade), Szabolcs de Vajay (Vevey)\nThe present work followed the task of identifying the motif of the fleur-de-lis in\ntwo groups of primary sources from medieval Bosnia: seals and coins on the one\nhand and the specific tombstones\u2014ste\u0107ci\u2014on the other. The appearance of the\nfleur-de-lis was analyzed from a political and social perspective, as the examined\nsources were connected with the Bosnian kings and the nobility. The time-span of\nresearch is focused mainly on the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\nIn the first place, the appearance of the lily on Bosnian seals and coins was\nexamined, which means in royal usage, and its place among the other symbols\nused by the Bosnian rulers; through its usage I have reflected on the political\nsituation of the time. In the second part of the thesis the analysis focused on\nhow often and in what way the lily was found on tombstones, and thereby, it\nwas demonstrated why it was used on them and what its significance was.\nThe Coronations of the First Bohemian Kings\nDemeter Malatak (Czech Republic)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00e1nos M. Bak\nExternal Reader: Josef \u017demli\u010dka (Akademie v\u011bd \u010cR, Historick\u00fd \u00fastav, Prague)\nThe stock of royal ritual and presentation as part of the history of power and\npolitics is an established concern. Monarchical rituals including, above all,\ninauguration were mediators of rulership ideology. Thus, the study of coronations\nand other rites of representation of power may reveal much about the essence of\n300Abstracts\npolitical power, especially in times where theoretical treatises on politics were rare.\nThe thesis also deals with the concept of coronations as rites of passage.\nIn medieval Bohemia, the coronations were closely connected with the\nrepresentation of kingship in opposition to ducal ceremonies. In general, the\ncoronation can be regarded especially as a ritual of the ruler\u2019s accession to\ngovernance. As a matter of fact, however, none of the P\u0159emyslid kings was\ncrowned at the time of his accession. It prompts the question of the significance\nof P\u0159emyslid coronations, which, along with the exploration of their form, is the\nmain concern of the thesis. The political background and the circumstances of\nritual performance are taken into account, and the original ritual of the ducal\nenthronement as an archaic equivalent to the coronation is not neglected either.\nThe thesis deals with the coronations of the three first kings in Bohemian\nhistory: Vratislav, Vladislav and Ottakar I P\u0159emysl. All these rulers had one\nthing in common. They were first installed as dukes and only later were they\nmade kings. They were the representatives of a shift in concepts of monarchic\npower. This aspect determined the unique nature of their coronations and\ndistinguished them from the coronations of their successors which already\nconstituted a part of well-established royal representation.\nThe examination of individual coronation rituals and their background led\nto the conclusion that the coronations of the first Bohemian rulers differed in\nterms of their form and significance. Thus the concept of rites of passage can be\napplied only to a certain extent. But all of these rituals contributed to the\nestablishing of the new patterns of representation of monarchic power. These\nroyal patterns showed a deep elaboration and expressed a complex structure of\npower.\nThe Attitude of the Latin and Orthodox Christians of the Second Half\nof the Eleventh Century (\u201cthe Schism\u201d Period) towards Each Other\nin the Polemic Treatises on the Procession of the Holy Spirit\n(by Peter Damian, Anselm of Canterbury, and Theophylact of Ochrid)\nAndrei Menchikov (Russia)\nThesis Supervisors: Istv\u00e1n Perczel, Gy\u00f6rgy Ger\u00e9by\nExternal Reader: Ivan Christov (Wissenschaftlich \u2013 Theologisches Seminar der\nUniversit\u00e4t Heidelberg)\nThe relationships between different cultures always fascinate not only scholarly\ninterest, but simple human curiosity as well. Most intriguing would be the study\n301Abstracts\nof those cultures that have a common origin and profess the same religion, but\ngradually come to understanding of their peculiarities and divergences.\nThe so-called \u201cSchism\u201d between the Eastern and Western Churches has a\nlong history: to interpret the excommunications of 1054 as a final and\nconclusive rupture is no longer acceptable, as the studies of Dvornik, Runciman\nand others have demonstrated. During this process of divorce, a minor issue\n(the addition of the Filioque to the creed) which at first deserved only rare\nmention among the \u201ccrimes\u201d of the other side, became a chief point of\ncontention. This one-word addition revealed the core of theological and\ncultural-historical differences of two traditions: the difference of the human\napproaches to the divinity, of the understanding of God, of ecclesiology and\nChurch ruling, and so on. My purpose was to inquire how both sides came to\nrealize this difference.\nAfter 1054, a few treatises were written about the procession of the Holy\nGhost: by Peter Damian in 1061\u20131062, by Anselm of Canterbury in 1098\u20131102,\nand by Theophylact of Ochrid in 1089\u20131091 (the last dating is the most\nuncertain). A few attempts at discussing this point were made, but all of them\nfailed to settle the problem. Thus, we have only these treatises to try to\ninvestigate how the discussion developed. Only in 1112 did both sides meet\neach other in an open dispute in the presence of the Emperor in\nConstantinople, but this deserves a separate study.\nIn this controversy many arguments were deployed. In short, the Latins\npresented the following: the argument of the same essence (the Father and the\nSon are of the same essence; therefore, they are both the causal origin of the\nSpirit); that of mission (the Son sends the Spirit from the Father; the Father\nsends the Spirit in the Son\u2019s name; this clearly indicates that they both are the\nsource both of mission and of procession); that of the Spirit\u2019s belonging to the\nSon (Scripture not once calls the Spirit \u201cthe Spirit of the Son,\u201d \u201cthe Spirit of\nChrist,\u201d and so on, therefore, if the Spirit is the Spirit of the Son, it is clear that\nthe Son is the \u201cproducer\u201d of the Spirit as well as the Father is); finally, Anselm\u2019s\nmain argument that the Spirit proceeds not from the paternity of the Father, but\nfrom the deity of the Father, and thus, since the Father and the Son are the\nsame deity, the Spirit proceeds from both equally, the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of\nGod, and His procession has nothing to do with the relation of the Father and\nthe Son, that is, with each one of them distinctly, apart from another.\nThe Greeks arrayed the following reasons against the Filioque: to introduce\nthe Filioque means to introduce the double causation into one and the same\nGodhead, thereby splitting the Godhead, and bringing the Spirit to\ncompositeness; if we attribute the procession to the Son, that means, that\nprocession from the Father is incomplete and imperfect, which is nonsense; it is\n302Abstracts\nnecessary to distinguish plainly the procession (as regards the existence of the\nHoly Spirit, His very esse) from all other operations (mission, infusion, bestowal,\ndistribution, and so on); the first may belong to the Father alone, while all the\nothers may be shared with the Son; we should clearly discern the properties of\nthe persons and never indulge in any contamination of each of them with the\nothers.\nThus, we see that a very different theological sensibility lies behind these\narguments, one which only gradually, slowly, did the controversialists realize.\nArmenian Sources for Early Hungarian History\nKorn\u00e9l Nagy (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: Istv\u00e1n Perczel, J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky\nExternal Readers: Giusto Traina (Dipartimento du Scienze dell\u2019Antichita, Universit\u00e0 di\nLecce), Mih\u00e1ly Dobrovits (ELTE, Budapest)\nThe goal of this thesis was to investigate the Armenian sources for early\nHungarian history. The thesis aims at presenting two Armenian sources on the\nappearance and presence of the Tetals and Sewordik\u2019 people. The Tetals first\nappeared in Seb\u0113os\u2019 Chronicle in the seventh century. The Sewordik\u2019 make their\nappearance in the middle of the ninth century and they could also occur under\nother names, Sabartoi Asphaloi, and Serbotion in Emperor Constantine\nPorphyrogenitus\u2019 works, De Administrando Imperio and De Aulae Byzantinae.\nThe major method to be applied in this thesis is a critical analysis of\nArmenian sources, including the chronological and geographical data that\noccurred in most of them. The chapters of the thesis were primarily devoted to\nthe Tetals in Seb\u0113os\u2019 Chronicle, to the presence of the Sewordik\u2019 in Patriarch\nJohn\u2019s Chronicle, to Constantine Porphyrogenitus\u2019 work, and to the name of the\nSabartoi Asphaloi. After analysing the Armenian sources, I can say the following.\nThe Tetals occurring in Seb\u0113os\u2019 Chronicle were not connected to the\nKhazars, but they could have been linked with the Ethiopians revolting against\nthe Arab caliphate. This theory has been proven by the corruption of the\nbiblical names in Seb\u0113os\u2019 Chronicle.\nEmperor Constantine could have taken his information about the Savards\nand Sewordik from current and accepted sources. Patriarch John, who was a\ncontemporary author of Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus, reported that\nthe Sewordik\u2019 had been faithful to Christianity, and gave three martyrs\n(Step\u2019anos also called Kon, Georg and Arw\u0113s) to the Armenian Church during\nthe ninth and the tenth centuries. It seems obvious that there could be a link\n303Abstracts\nbetween the Savards in Armenia and the Hungarians (Turkoi) in the Carpathian\nbasin. The Armenian geographical name Ma\u0135garajor in the province of Uti could\nbe related to the district of the Sewordik\u2019. The Sabartoi Asphaloi could be a Greek\nform of the Armenian phrase Aspetk\u2019 Sewordik\u2019, which could also indicate to us\nthat the Sewordik\u2019 had already begun to assimilate with the Armenians in the\nmiddle of the tenth century.\nWith regard to the large number of the known and unknown Armenian\nsources, the present thesis is not sufficient to solve completely the problems of\nearly Hungarian history. This thesis must be primarily regarded as an initial stage\nof a very large work; therefore, this topic needs very thorough investigation in\nyears to come.\nFighting Wycliff: Encoded Messages\nin Love\u2019s Mirrour of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ\nZsuzsanna Nagy (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Readers: Lesley Smith (Harris Manchester College, Oxford), Michael Sargent\n(Department of English, Queen\u2019s College), Sylvain Pyron (Centre de Recherches\nHistoriques, EHESS)\nI have investigated two illuminated manuscripts: the National Library of\nScotland Advocates MS 18.1.7 and the Pierpont Morgan Library MS m 648.\nBoth contain the text of Nicholas Love\u2019s translation into Middle English of the\nLatin Meditationes Vitae Christi, attributed to Bonaventura. The translation of\nNicholas Love was approved by Archbishop Arundel, guaranteeing that the\nwork was appropriate for the instruction of the believers and for the refutation\nof the Lollard heresy. I have attempted to demonstrate that the anti-Lollard\nprogramme was encoded into both the text of the translation and into the\nillumination of the two manuscripts. Although the text has already been studied\nfrom this aspect, new details could be added, resulting in a deeper understanding\nof how Nicholas Love succeeded in creating the instructional and refutational\nmessage on various levels of the text. In parallel, the illuminations of both\nmanuscripts, although they have a different character as regards the quality of\nproduction, style, as well as certain iconographic preferences, attest the existence\nof the same anti-Lollard message.\nThe comparative analysis of the two manuscripts, investigating them in a\ntext and images context, testifies to the same effort of the Church against the\nWycliffite dissent.\n304Abstracts\nTheory and Practice of Style in the Letters of Gregory of Nazianzus\nArvydas Pliucas (Lithuania)\nThesis Supervisor: Gy\u00f6rgy Karsai\nExternal Reader: R\u00f3bert Somos (PTE, P\u00e9cs)\nThe work concentrates on the theory of letter-writing presented by Gregory of\nNazianzus in his letters to Nicobulus (letters 51, 52, and 54), comparing it, as well,\nwith Gregory\u2019s practice of letter-writing. A theoretical analysis of the concepts\ndiscussed in these letters (conciseness, clarity, charm) shows that Gregory is quite\nclose to the tradition of epistolography as seen in some treatises of Antiquity,\nstarting from the Peri\\ e(rmhnei/a\uf06a\uf020of Demetrius. Some deviations from\nthe tradition are attempted to be explained by analysing Gregory\u2019s theory in the\ncontext of more general Antique theories of style. This analysis has shown that the\ndeviations can be explained, and also that Gregory is well aware of the theories\nand coherent in using his main stylistic concepts. He also shows some originality\nin the way he is handling these theories, using one point and leaving out another.\nThe results obtained were complemented with a prosopographical analysis\nof the letters to Nicobulus, which helped connect them with Gregory\u2019s letters to\na rhetorician, Eudoxius (174\u2013180), thus establishing a more exact dating of the\nletters (383) and helping to define their audience.\nThis is complemented with a rhetorical analysis of both groups of letters,\nwhich has helped establish the connection of two of them with the treatises of\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, who has also proved to be very important when\ncarrying out the analysis of the theoretical stylistic concepts of Gregory.\nAn analysis of Gregory\u2019s epistolary practice is also added, illustrating how\nthese theoretical concepts are put into practice.\nWestern Influences on the Iconography of the Medieval Orthodox\nPainting in Transylvania: Murals in the Sanctuaries\nElena-Dana Prioteasa (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs\nExternal Readers: Ecaterina Cincheza-Buculei (Bucharest) Andr\u00e1s Kov\u00e1cs\n(Babe\u015f-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca)\nThis study deals with the murals in the sanctuaries of three medieval Orthodox\nchurches in Transylvania. The paintings were selected among the preserved\nmurals in medieval Orthodox churches, as they show Western influence on the\n305Abstracts\niconography. The painting in the church of Streis\u00e2ngeorgiu (Sztrigyszentgy\u00f6rgy)\ndates from 1313\u201314, the painting in the church of Strei (Zeykfalva) dates from\nthe fourteenth century, and the painting in the church of H\u0103lmagiu\n(Nagyhalm\u00e1gy) dates from the first half of the fifteenth century.\nMedieval Transylvania was a place of Western-Eastern interactions, which\nmanifested themselves in art as well. This study analyzes the changes that\noperated in the Byzantine iconography of the Orthodox churches, how these\nchanges fitted the liturgical symbolism of the sanctuary, and what the Western\ncontribution to these changes was. To this aim, the iconography of the painting\nof the three sanctuaries is compared with the requirements of Byzantine\niconography and to Western painting, mainly from medieval Hungary.\nThe results of this study show that the selection which operated among the\nWestern iconographic subjects was guided by the intention to stay close, at least\nformally, if not in message, to the main guidelines of Byzantine iconography.\nSome Western iconographic subjects seem to have been a custom in the\ndecoration of the medieval Orthodox churches, but these were also those which\nwere used at one point in Byzantine painting. Nevertheless, there are also\nspecific Western iconographic subjects, which might raise the question of more\nsignificant devotional interactions.\nPrince Yaroslav Sangushko\u2019s Murder Case as an Example of the Criminal\nInvestigation in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1564\u20131565)\nSerhiy Rybak (Russia)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00e1nos M. Bak\nExternal Reader: Oleksij Tolochko (Institute of History, Ukrainian Academy of\nSciences, Kiev)\nDuring the night of 4\u20135 September, 1564, a representative of a powerful\naristocratic family, Yaroslav Sangushko, was fatally wounded; in a few days he\ndied. The event took place in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Volyn\u2019 land. The\nmurder resulted in a criminal investigation and a trial, which lasted more than a\nyear and finished with the final sentence of the Grand Duke.\nThe aim of the thesis is to analyse what procedures were used in\nconducting a murder trial in Lithuania in the late Middle Ages; to show which\nlaws and customs were the bases for such an investigation; and to find out how\nthe social status of people involved influenced this trial. The aim of the thesis is\nalso to show how practices of customary law influenced this particular trial.\n306Abstracts\nOne of peculiarities of this criminal case was that while the victim and the\naccuser, the former\u2019s brother Roman Sangushko, were Lithuanian princes, the\nsuspect, Valentii Zhelekh, was a Polish noble. This study shows how the\nconduct of a trial was influenced by the absence of distinct rules of conducting\nan investigation because the people involved were noblemen of different\ncountries.\nA Gnostic Doctrine in the Light of the Tractatus Tripartitus\nP\u00e9ter S\u00e1rosi (Hungary)\nThesis Thesis Supervisors: Istv\u00e1n Perczel, Gy\u00f6rgy Ger\u00e9by\nExternal Readers: Ulrich Luft (ELTE, Budapest), Christoph Markschies\n(Wissenschaftlich-Theologisches Seminar der Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg)\nThe thesis aims to present a Valentinian Gnostic cosmological doctrine on the\ntriple disposition of the world and humankind. According to this doctrine,\neverything came to be from three substances: spiritual, psychical and material.\nOne of these substances is planted in every being as a dominating \u201cseed,\u201d which\ndetermines its destiny. This contribution attempts to investigate this teaching as\nit is expounded in a late Valentinian text, the Tractatus Tripartitus (NHC 1.5).\nThe text is subjected to a comparative analysis in order to point out the\ndifferent versions of this doctrine in the light of scholarly debates. The burning\nquestion what the analysis needs to answer is a soteriological one: who and how\ncan be redeemed, and what is the relation between body, soul and spirit in\nValentinian theories versus orthodox dogmas? In one respect the Valentinian\ndoctrine of triple disposition reflects a deterministic worldview in which there is\nno room for human personality and free will. This is an extreme structural\ndeterminism, inherited from Greek philosophy and the deterministic worldview of\nGreek tragedies, in which there is no room for human personality and free will.\nConversely, if we consider the whole system in the light of the divine\nprovidence and redemption, a completely different optimistic picture occurs, a\nflexible eschatological mysticism, based on the Gospels.\n307Abstracts\nIdentification and Self-Identification of the Crimean Goths and Alans:\nGothi or Gothalani?\nOleksiy Smirnov (Ukraine)\nThesis Supervisors: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky, J\u00e1nos M. Bak\nExternal Reader: Tivadar Vida (Archaeological Institute, Hungarian Academy of\nSciences, Budapest)\nOn the basis of our sources on the ethnic structure of the south-western Crimea\nwe can assume that there is a dichotomy between the archaeological evidence\nand the written material. The archaeological evidence seems to attest the\npredominance of the Alans, although in the written sources the Goths are\nmentioned much more often than the Alans. In my work I tried to explain this\ndichotomy.\nIn most cases we are dealing with identification by others, and not self-\nidentification, of the inhabitants of south-western Crimea. Their identification\ndepended on the nature of the written sources: their origin and the purposes for\nwhich they were written, as well the religion, ethnicity and the language of their\nauthors, should be taken into consideration. After the analysis of the Byzantine\nGreek, Latin, Italian, Old Church Slavonic and Arabic written material I came to\nthe conclusion that the names \u201cGothia\u201d and \u201cGoths\u201d in most cases are used as\npolitical terms, and refer to both Germanic and Alanic ethnic components. This\nis especially true for the Byzantine sources, which followed a tradition of Late\nAntique historical writings. The Crimean Alans as such are usually mentioned in\nnon-Byzantine sources.\nThe population of Gothia was mixed, and it is hard to say to what extent.\nBut as archaeological material and some Genoese and Arabic written sources\nattest, the Alan ethnic element prevailed. The ethnonym Gothalani mentioned by\nIosafat Barbaro in the first half of the fifteenth century seems to reflect more\nprecisely the current ethnic situation in the Crimean Gothia.\nDue to the gradual hellenisation of the Crimean Goths and Alans in the\nsources of the period between the thirteenth and sixteenth century, they often\nappear under the name \u201cGreek.\u201d Some sources of that period attest their\ntartarisation. Tartar names, which some Christian inhabitants of the south-\nwestern Crimea bore, illustrate this process very well. However, in sources from\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Gothic and Alan languages are still\nmentioned. At that period they seem to have been on the verge of extinction,\nalthough they could still have been preserved in some isolated villages in the\nmountains.\n308Abstracts\nThe process of the assimilation of the Crimean Goths and Alans with the\nGreeks and Tartars became more active after the fall of the Principality of\nTheodoro in 1475. After that date ethnic awareness became identical with the\nconfession. The differences between the Goths and Alans were no longer\nimportant; some of them became Greeks by remaining Christian, while those\nwho exchanged Christianity for Islam assimilated with the Tartars. Among the\nCrimean Christians, who in 1788 were deported to the northern coast of the Sea\nof Azov and now are called Mariupol Greeks, there are probably some\ndescendants of the Crimean Goths and Alans.\nMoney, Mentality, Community (Caffa in the Fourteenth Century)\nStefan Stantchev (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisor: Gerhard Jaritz, Bal\u00e1zs Nagy\nExternal Readers: Felicitas Schmieder (Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t, Frankfurt\nam Main), Enrico Basso (Soprintendenza Archivistica per la Liguria, Genoa)\nThe main aim of this research was to examine the way economic life influenced\nsocial life in a multiethnic society. A Genoese-governed multiethnic community,\nat the time when Genoa was at the apogee of its economic and political\nstrength, was selected as the study area. Analysis of the available source material,\nconsisting mainly of notarial deeds, is followed by a comparative and integrative\nanalysis of normative and administrative sources. This showed not only that\nCaffa was a society relying entirely on trade, but that its economic life deeply\ninfluenced the social life and mentality of its citizens.\nMoney appears to be the best explanation for the particularity of Caffa\u2019s\nsociety. The amounts of money invested in trade, ships, real estate and slaves,\nand playing a part in the inheritance process, show that the capital invested in\ntrade or ships outranked any other investment. Two basic aims appear to have\ngoverned economic life in Caffa: the need for floating capital and the search for\nfast liquidity.\nThese features of economic life influenced many aspects of social life.\nCaffa\u2019s districts do not appear to have been organized according to the social\nstatus or the ethnic/religious affiliation of its citizens. Accumulating real estate\nwas not the main goal of Caffa\u2019s citizens in the fourteenth century; the\nownership of houses in Caffa was merely practical and not socially\nrepresentative. Representatives of different ethnic and religious groups\nconstantly interacted with each other with regard to real estate.\n309Abstracts\nThe money-oriented mind epitomized not only the Genoese, but also the\nrepresentatives of other ethnic and religious groups, mainly Greeks, Armenians,\nand Muslims. The specific geopolitical situation of a city located far from areas\nwhere ideology, either religious or political, prevailed over economy explains\nCaffa\u2019s particular image in notarial deeds. More than the Italian maritime\nrepublics themselves and even more than their overseas dominions, Caffa\u2019s\nsocial life was influenced by the economy to a point where common economic\ninterests brought about tolerance and prosperity with few parallels at that time.\nBut Caffa society was also a mobile society. Not only were many of its\ncitizens constantly traveling and (some of them) regularly changing their places\nof residence, but it was also mobile in terms of its ethnic composition and social\nstructure. Most of the Latins who became Caffa residents represented a\nqualified workforce, and were not peasants as one would expect from a\ncomparison to Italy. Notaries, doctors, administrative officials, and craftsmen\nwere usually also merchants. This \u201call-merchant\u201d character of Caffa society as\npresented in notarial deeds played a crucial role in paving the way to its\nprosperity.\nFinally, Caffa society was a specific community featuring the co-existence\nof different ethnic and religious groups brought closer to each other by their\ncommon economic interests. However, this common economic interest would\nhave hardly influenced social life and mentality in Caffa without the favorable\nmacro-economic, political, and religious context that existed in the northern\nBlack Sea area during the fourteenth century.\nThe Problems of Kindred Monasteries: A Case Study of \u00c1kos Monastery\nP\u00e9ter Levente Sz\u0151cs (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs, J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky\nExternal Readers: Mikl\u00f3s Tak\u00e1cs (Archaeological Institute, Hungarian Academy of\nSciences, Budapest), Istv\u00e1n Petrovics (University of Szeged)\nThe Abbey Church of \u00c1kos (Ac\u00e2\u015f, Romania) is among the best preserved\nRomanesque monuments in the medieval Hungarian Kingdom. In 1998, an\narchaeological excavation was started here, in order to reveal the architectural\nhistory of the abbey church. The present study proposes to combine the results\nof this excavation with an inquiry on the history of the \u00c1kos kindred\u2014the\npatron family of the monastery. The information that is provided by this\ninterdisciplinary research creates the basis of a case study. The architectural\nsimilarities and the historical connections placed the abbey of \u00c1kos among the\n310Abstracts\nso-called \u2019kindred monasteries\u2019. Therefore, the case study of \u00c1kos monastery\ncan be integrated in the general debate on this issue, offering answers to two\nquestions. The functional analysis of the basilica\u2014with its annexed chapel and\nthe cemetery around it\u2014serves as an example of the representational and\ndevotional demands of a high status monastery-founder in the twelfth century.\nIn addition, the late medieval evolution of the church within the history of the\npatron family will illustrate the decline and the secularization process of kindred\nmonasteries.\nThe first chapter gives a brief historiographic presentation, divided\naccording to the three main fields of study, and discusses the problems of\nkindred monasteries. The second chapter presents the results of the architectural\nand archaeological research on the abbey church. The history of the \u00c1kos\nkindred and its estates is presented in the third chapter, while at the end the\nconclusions of the present inquiry are offered.\nThe abbey church of \u00c1kos was built in a single phase, with changes of the\narchitectural plan (building differently sized naves than was planned initially).\nThe patrons created several more spaces beside the main sanctuary, which could\nhave had liturgical functions: the side-chapel and the western galleries. The\nlatter, however, had strong social significance, creating the possibility for social\ndisplay. The accent on the eastern arrangement shows the influence of monastic\nreform\u2014at least in the architecture of the church. The analysis of the cemetery,\nwhich surrounds the church, shows that a limited community\u2014most probably\nthe patron family\u2014used the churchyard as a burial place during the Middle\nAges.\nHistorical research presented a slow decay of the \u00c1kos family, which\nfinally caused the loss of the monastery. This entailed the dissolution of the\nmonastery\u2014in the second half of the fifteenth century, when the name of the\nvillage became only \u00c1kos, without the part that referred to the monastery.\nMoreover, the family history shows that the monastery of \u00c1kos was disregarded\nduring the thirteenth century. The most influential family members, acquiring\nnew estates and funding new family-branches, had lost their interest in the old\nfamily monastery. In contrast, they made new foundations, favoring the newly\ncreated religious orders.\nThe historiographical overview had a methodological conclusion: further\ncase studies are necessary to solve the open questions on kindred monasteries.\nThese case studies should apply an interdisciplinary approach, jointly using\nsocial historical, ecclesiastical, art historical and archaeological methods. Only in\nthis way can that complex micro-cosmos that a monastery represented be\nadequately described.\n311Abstracts\nThe Guide of the Perplexed as an Encoded Text:\nTowards a New Methodology\nTam\u00e1s Visi (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: Gy\u00f6rgy Ger\u00e9by, Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Yossef Schwartz (Department of Philosophy, Hebrew University of\nJerusalem, Mount Scopus)\nLeo Strauss, in his Persecution and the Art of Writing (1952), claimed that\nMaimonides\u2019 major philosophical work, The Guide of the Perplexed (circa 1190;\nhereafter GP) is an encoded text. Readers need to use special reading techniques\nto discover its hidden message. Consequently, Strauss proposed a methodology\nof decoding Maimonides\u2019 encoded message.\nStrauss\u2019 thesis has been heavily criticised by traditional historians of\nphilosophy. A leading voice from this camp, Oliver Leaman, claimed that\nStrauss\u2019 proposal was simply irrelevant. The history of philosophy is not\nconcerned with the hidden or open personal views of Maimonides on this or\nthat topic, but with the arguments presented by him in favour of a statement.\nTherefore, the interpretation of GP should focus on Maimonides\u2019 arguments\nand not on some dubious esoteric doctrines.\nA solution to this debate might be to propose a new method of reading the\nGP that justifies both parties in a way. Philosophy is about arguments, not just\nhidden or open personal views\u2014this concept of philosophy is shared by\nMaimonides as well as many other philosophers. However, the core of Leo\nStrauss\u2019 thesis can be saved if we propose a method based on Straussian\nprinciples for discovering the hidden doctrine of GP\u2014but focusing on hidden\narguments instead of hidden personal views.\nIn the first chapter I propose a methodology of reading Maimonides. In\nthe rest of the thesis I try to test this methodology by interpreting Maimonides\u2019\nproofs for the existence of God. The analysis shows that\n(1) Maimonides\u2019 argument fails to prove the existence of God,\n(2) Maimonides himself was aware of this fact,\n(3) he refrained from disclosing this fact, because it might be upsetting\nand harmful for ordinary people, and\n(4) a hidden argument about the existence of God is hinted in the text of\nGP.\n312",

So in mid-June\nthe graduation ceremony comprised the largest-ever group from our department\nto be hooded in front of several hundred MA students, distinguished guests, and\nGeorge Soros, the founder of our University. This event could be regarded as\nthe culmination of the academic year, but in fact it was followed by the week-\nlong celebration of the tenth anniversary of the department.\nAs we planned the program for the anniversary, we identified two main\ngoals for these festive events.

Our\n210ABSTRACTS\nIbn Khald\u016bn on Magic and the Occult\nMushegh Asatryan (Armenia)\nThesis Supervisor: Aziz Al-Azmeh\nExternal Reader: S\u00e1ndor Fodor (ELTE, Department of Arabic and Semitic Studies)\nThe fourteenth-century Muslim thinker Ibn Khald\u016bn dedicated several sections\nof his most important treatise Muqaddima (Prolegomenon) to the refutation of\noccult sciences, such as alchemy, magic, divination, and so on, and to the nature\nof prophecy and sainthood. He also composed a separate book called The cure for\none who asks for the improvement of questions (Shif\u0101\u2019 al-s\u0101\u2019il li tahdh\u012bb al mas\u0101\u2019il), where\nhe discusses the nature of sainthood. Not much has been done in the scholar-\nship to analyse Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s views on these matters. There are only a few\naccounts of them, and even these generally constitute parts of larger works and\nare therefore of a very general character, with relatively little analysis. The\npresent work analyses Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s attitude towards these specific matters, to\nhighlight the main arguments he used in his refutations, and to show how these\narguments correlate with each other. In particular, I point out Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s\ninterest in occult sciences from the point of view of their significance for human\ncivilisation and the state. In order to situate Ibn Khald\u016bn in the historical\ncontext and to show the reasons for his keen interest in prophecy, sainthood\nand the occult sciences, my introduction gives a brief account of those political\nmovements in northern Africa which in their origins had a messianic impetus.\nThe thesis shows that the great importance that prophetic and messianic\nmovements had for the history of Islam, and for the history of northern Africa\nin particular, were the main conditions that determined Ibn Khald\u016bn\u2019s keen\ninterest in matters of prophecy, sainthood and all kinds of occultism. However,\nthe main subject of my study is the analysis of the text itself, the task of situating\nIbn Khald\u016bn\u2019s work in the historical context providing the overall framework.\n213Abstracts\nPhysiognomy in the Descriptions and\nPortraits of King Matthias Corvinus\nEnik\u0151 B\u00e9k\u00e9s (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: Marcell Seb\u0151k\nExternal Reader: \u00c1rp\u00e1d Mik\u00f3 (Hungarian National Gallery, Budapest)\nThe aim of this thesis is to analyse the representations, both textual and visual,\nof King Matthias Corvinus in the light of Antique physiognomical theories. I\nfocused mainly on those descriptions and portraits which were influenced by the\nlion\u2019s physiognomy. The portraits and the iconography of King Matthias have\nbeen studied exhaustively; however, hitherto scholars have not dedicated more\nthan a paragraph to the topic of physiognomy, except for Peter Meller, who was\nthe first and almost the last in publishing an article about the lion\u2019s physi-\nognomy as applied to Matthias. The last chapter deals also with the portraits of\nMatthias, but with the Attila-faun-like images. These representations, however,\nreflect an entirely different image from that of the lion. They must be treated\nseparately also because they are not contemporary portraits and the circum-\nstances of their commission are very obscure.\nThe method of my analysis is mainly philological: I compare the character-\nistic traits of the textual and visual portraits with the physiognomical writings,\nand try to demonstrate that the theories could indeed have influenced the repre-\nsentations. I provide an overview of two main ideas before this examination: the\ntradition of physiognomical representations from antiquity onwards and the\nsymbolism of the lion, in order to outline the context of King Matthias\u2019 images.\nThe approach in the case of the Attila-type images is the same: after a survey of\nthe tradition of Attila\u2019s textual and visual representations I analyse the portraits\nof Matthias again by comparing their features with the physiognomical\ndoctrines.\nThe physiognomical analysis of King Matthias\u2019 portraits supports the hy-\npothesis that the ruler\u2019s representations were indeed constructed according to\ncertain ideals by applying patterns inherited from antiquity onwards. It can also\nbe stated that in the shaping of Matthias\u2019 physiognomy the ruler had an even\nmore important role than the Italian Humanists. We can plausibly place the\nleonine images of King Matthias among the Renaissance state-portraits, which\nwere also in accordance with the king\u2019s political intentions.\nThe analysis has also proved by philological evidence that physiognomy\ncould indeed have influenced the descriptions and portraits of the king. The role\nof Galeotto Marzio must have been crucial in mediating the physiognomical\n214Abstracts\ntheories in the Buda court. Furthermore, in his work physiognomy appears as an\nelement of the theories related to good governance.\nA Comparative Study of Jewish and Christian Vernacular Bibles in\nMedieval Italy\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Benke (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: Piroska Nagy\nExternal Reader: G\u00e9za Komor\u00f3czy (ELTE and Research Center for Jewish Studies,\nHungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest)\nThe most consistent conflicts between Jews and Christians have hinged on their\ndiffering readings of Biblical passages. For Christians, the chief value of the Old\nTestament lay in the prophecies and \u201cprefigurations\u201d that, as they believe, were\nfulfilled in the life and death of Jesus of Nazareth. Jews reading the same texts\nmight understand them as personifications of the vanquished people of Israel,\napply them to the future redemption or, in many cases, fail to discern any\nmessianic content whatsoever. Nevertheless, they certainly had to react to the\nattacks against their faith, forming a response to soften the effects of Christian\nproselytising; as in most districts of central Italy during the sixteenth century,\nJews were compelled to attend missionary sermons delivered by mendicant\npreachers. The most suitable spaces for such a reaction were the synagogue and\nthe elementary school\u2013\u2013two places where vernacular translations were in use for\nthe edification of the most vulnerable part of the community, that is \u201csimple\npeople,\u201d women and children.\nNo scholar has yet dealt in depth with the only complete Judeo-Italian\nBible: mere sample texts have recently been studied, chiefly from the linguistic\nviewpoint. The greatest ambition of this thesis is to take the first steps towards\nan explanatory treatment of an uncharted Biblical tradition. Moreover, this step\nis made from the standpoint of what I hope is a rather innovative approach: the\npaper tries to bring to light the manner in which medieval translations of the\nBible prepared by Italian Jews contained anti-Christian polemical material. It\naims at the analysis of Christological proof texts that were among the most\naccentuated ones in the course of Jewish-Christian religious encounters, and\nthus most probably form a doctrinal fault-line between the vernacular Bibles of\nthe two communities.\n215Abstracts\nThe Goldsmiths of Kolozsv\u00e1r (Cluj-Napoca) in the Sixteenth and\nSeventeenth Centuries\n\u00c1gnes Fl\u00f3ra (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: Katalin Szende\nExternal Reader: Derek Keene (Institute of Historical Research, Centre for\nMetropolitan History, London)\nThe social status of goldsmiths within the urban community of the town of\nKolozsv\u00e1r (Cluj-Napoca) has never been discussed in the context of a scholarly\nwork. The present thesis is an attempt to follow the tripartite division of Pierre\nBordieu\u2019s theory and to create an analytical survey of goldsmiths\u2019 role in\nmunicipal life.\nFirst, as a reflection of the goldsmiths\u2019 cultural \u201ccapital,\u201d the artisans\u2019\npresence in the town\u2019s self-government is discussed. They had a large represen-\ntation in the town councils, fulfilling important municipal services, which\ndemonstrates not only their personal aptitude and education, but also the high\nrespect of the whole community which delegated them. The main basis of this\nrespect was certainly money, earthly wealth earned by work. Although the gold-\nsmiths did not intensively pursue trade, they usually made a profit from their\nmoney by investing in real estate, as many examples from the third chapter\nreveal.\nThe goldsmiths\u2019 buildings were usually located around the main square of\nthe town, which was due not only to economic reasons, but also to their\nendeavour to gain respect and prestige. Reviewing the tax registers, one might\nnotice a kind of professional cohesion inside the quarters of the town. More and\nmore goldsmiths gathered around one nucleus, forming a kind of positive\nsegregation. The topographical analysis also reveals that the great development\nof the guild at the turn of the seventeenth century was not the effect of an\nexternal influx but an of an internal transformation of the craftsmen\u2019s society.\nBeing a goldsmith in the early modern society of Kolozsv\u00e1r was equal to\nthe integration into the patriciate of the town\u2014a fact accentuated even more\nafter the minting house was transferred to the town and the goldsmiths\u2019 role\nbecame even more important.\n216Abstracts\nEncaustic:\nRelations between Requirements and the Ancient Painting Technique\nMaria Grechulevich (Georgia)\nThesis Supervisors: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky, B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs.\nExternal Reader: Istv\u00e1n B\u00f3na, Jr. (University of Fine Arts, Budapest)\nThe theme of this thesis is the encaustic method of painting in Late Antiquity\nand the Middle Ages. Research on the encaustic technique is based on two\nimportant primary sources: surviving visual material and literature written by\nancient writers. I discuss the technique of encaustic and consequently its tools\n(cestrum, cauterium, and peniculum or brush), and materials (wax, pigments, and\nadditional materials that were meant to make the process of painting easier). I\nalso refer to the reasons why only such a small number of encaustic icons\nexisted in Christian iconography. Through the historical analysis of images\ncreated in the past, I tried to find a link between the date of the disappearance\nof the technique and facts contradicting this statement about encaustic as a lost\nart\u2013\u2013an idea that appears in almost all the secondary literature on encaustic.\nThis thesis is not limited to a historical approach. Besides research on\nwhen and why encaustic can be regarded as a lost technique, or whether it\nshould be regarded as such, my approach is also experimental. My experiments\nfollow the course of the painting process sequentially and provide analytical\ninformation deriving from my experiments in this technique, conducted in April\n2003 under the supervision of Dr. Istv\u00e1n B\u00f3na Jr. I use the results of my\nexperiment to revisit information previously presented in the literature.\nIn order to better understand the questions of whether encaustic really did\ndisappear and when or whether its track was merely lost in time, I refer to a\nsample of known images created in encaustic in the past. After organizing them\nin four separate groups by chronology and places of preservation, I use them to\ninterpret encaustic as painting method that was probably used in periods after\nantiquity, when it was believed to have been forgotten, and to show that\nencaustic painting was appreciated in different geographical areas. One can\nsuspect that other encaustic pictures unknown to art historians may exist in\nsome abandoned churches or in private collections, awaiting future discovery.\n217Abstracts\nEmotional Narratives as Legitimation: Studies of the Polish and\nHungarian Gesta Traditions\nMax Hamon (Canada)\nThesis Supervisor: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Veszpr\u00e9my\nExternal Reader: Patrick Geary (UCLA)\nThis thesis involves a literary analysis of narrative histories in the High Middle\nAges that analyses the way in which emotional narratives were used to construct\nchronicles or gesta of certain communities. Taking the traditions of Hungarian\nand Polish gesta writing as examples, a comparative approach is used to discuss\nthe narrative structure and artistic style that were used in writing these histories.\nBy combining literary and social analyses of the emotional narratives, this\nthesis proves that there was great concordance within the gesta genre. Using the\ntools of biblical exegesis, intertextual comparison and narrative analysis, a\npicture of high medieval historical writing appears. The conclusion is that there\nwas considerable use of similar themes and even phrases in constructing a\nnarrative history.\nThe examples of emotional narratives which are studied here are weeping\nand anger. Looking at the representation of these emotions in the texts allows us\na better understanding of the medieval concept of emotions in general, and\nthese two specific case studies in particular. This thesis argues that emotional\nnarratives were easily used to represent positive or negative characteristics in\nindividuals. Furthermore, the practice of positive or negative representation\nallowed a strong ideological, or even propagandistic, construction of history.\nThus emotions could be used as a tool for legitimizing a certain institution.\nFor the purposes of legitimation certain topoi were used which were socially\nunderstood and recognised. This thesis explores those topoi and their function.\nThe most striking results can be summarised in a few sentences. Weeping seems\nto represent an emotion which was generally ascribed in a positive manner,\ninterestingly, it seems also to have been associated with suffering and inaction.\nIn contrast to weeping, anger was much more ambivalent. It could describe\nboth positive and negative characteristics depending upon the context;\nmoreover, anger was associated with effective action.\nThis thesis offers a contribution to both the study of emotions and the\nstudy of gesta as a tightly knit class of literature which ought to be explored\nfurther. It has been a useful study and will at least allow, and hopefully even\nencourage, new perspectives and approaches to an old field.\n218Abstracts\nThe Evolution of Gregory Akindynos\u2019 Religious Stance as Given by his\nCorrespondence\nAndrei Konovalov (Russia)\nThesis Supervisor: Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Basil Markesinis (Catholic University of Leuven)\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the figure of one of the polemists of the\nhesychast controversy, Gregory Akindynos, and analyse the evolution of his\nreligious and philosophical stance as seen through his letters, which were written\nin the 1330s and 1340s. From the nineteenth century onwards, researchers\nshowed a growing interest towards the letters of Akindynos; however, it is\nsurprising that even after the complete publication of all the preserved epistles\nof Akindynos by A. C. Hero in 1983, scholars (except for a few researchers)\nwere not inspired to revise generally accepted notions of the comparatively\n\u201cinsignificant\u201d role of Akindynos in the hesychast controversy and emphasise\nhis individual theological position.\nAnalysing Akindynos\u2019 epistles, I came to the conclusion that his own posi-\ntion before 1341 remained equally alien to Barlaam\u2019s critique of the hesychast\npsychosomatic method of prayer and to Palamas\u2019 teaching about God\u2019s essence\nand operations. The first serious charge against Palamas, which was worked out\nby Akindynos after the Councils of 1341, was the likeness of Palamas\u2019 doctrines\nto Arianism, insofar as Arius thought that the Son was created and consequently\nHe does not have any common essence with the Father, and Palamas taught\nthat the operations of God are likewise distinguished from His essence.\nAlthough the first charges of Messalianism appeared in Akindynos\u2019 letters\napproximately simultaneously with the charges of Arianism, the detailed\nexplanation of the \u201cMessalian heresy\u201d of Palamas was developed by Akindynos\ntwo years later. These accusations were directed exclusively against Palamas and\nhis followers, and concerned the fact that both groups desired to see God with\nbodily eyes.\nAt the same time Akindynos did not attack the hesychasts en masse, limiting\nhimself to attacks on Palamas. One of the main errors of Palamas, according to\nAkindynos, was the separation of the operations of God from His essence; this\nmade God not all-transcendent and omnipotent. According to Akindynos\u2019\nargumentation, the essence and the operation of God must be the same: if there\nhad been something in God that had not been the operation then God would\nnot have completely acted by Himself. The defenders of Palamas\u2019 doctrines\nwere not able critically to oppose Akindynos\u2019 reasoning without changes in the\nteaching itself, and it was only in the fifteenth century that the followers of\n219Abstracts\nPalamas moderated Palamas\u2019 teaching, when the anti-Palamite resistance had\nalready been broken. Akindynos\u2019 correspondence contains some information\nthat allows us to suppose that even in Palamas\u2019 time there were a number of\nPalamites who tried to moderate his teaching.\nIn general, in the same manner that Barlaam\u2019s critique of the hesychast\nprayer furthered the development of Palamas\u2019 doctrine as a response, Akindy-\nnos\u2019 charges facilitated the evolution of Palamas\u2019 teaching to the form that was\naccepted by the Church in the fifteenth century.\nChrist before His Judges:\nAn Iconographic Study of Central European Gothic Paintings\nJana Kov\u00e1\u010dov\u00e1 (Slovakia)\nThesis Supervisors: Gerhard Jaritz, B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs\nExternal Reader: Zsuzsa Urbach (P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University, Piliscsaba)\nPaintings of Christ before his Judges are one particular element in the sequence\nof the trial of Christ in his passion. Scholars have not paid attention to the\nparticular scenes yet; often the same painting is described and iconographically\nidentified in the literature in two or more different ways. On a sample of\ncollected Central European paintings this study describes the details, such as\nvestments, headgear and gestures, depicted on these scenes that could be the\nattributes of individual judges of Christ. The two religious judges, Annas and\nCaiaphas, Jewish high priests, may have as one attribute headgear which\nsymbolises their social status. But the most significant attribute of Caiaphas is\nhis gesture of ripping his tunic, because the mitre he wears is the sign of his\npriesthood, not his anger when he said Blasphemavit! as the answer to the words\nof Jesus. The headgear is not a sufficient attribute for any of the judges; the\nidentity of a judge has to be supported by his position on the throne, because on\nsome paintings another Jewish priest, wearing a mitre, but not questioning Jesus,\nappears in the crowd.\nThe scenes of the religious trial are more established, and the significant\ngesture of Pilate, washing his hands, is his strongest attribute. The second\npolitical ruler judging Christ, Herod, keeps the symbols of power, the crown and\nsceptre, as his attributes. Describing the two parts of the trial, religious and\npolitical, separately, the concluding part compares the representation of both\nand places them into the framework of the passion cycle.\nComparisons show regional differences in picturing the sequence of the\ntrial. While a longer sequence of the trial was traditional in the northwestern\n220Abstracts\nareas, mostly in Silesia and western Pomerania, in the southern parts and\nregions, such as Tyrol or Slovenia, the authors depicted one single scene as the\nsymbolic representation of the whole trial. In Slovakia, in Kyjatice and \u017dehra,\nscenes of questioning appear with a rare iconography that combines the\nattributes of the judges. In Jawor, Silesia, we can see the depiction of a unique\niconography based on the meditative literature.\nBesides the scenes where the figures can be easily identified by their\nattributes, there is one type of the questioning scene where the lack of attributes\ndoes not allow us to identify the judge. The Angevin Legendary accompanying\nthe illustrations with written sentences shows that the identity of the judges on\nthe depictions was not clear in the Middle Ages either. The different depictions\nof this scene convey different interpretations: while the long sequence of\nquestioning scenes underlines the narrative aspect, the single-scene represen-\ntation of the whole trial expresses its symbolic meaning.\nThe Foundation Myths of Medieval Ragusa\nLovro Kun\u010devi\u0107 (Croatia)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00e1nos M. Bak\nExternal Readers: Zdenka Janekovi\u0107-R\u00f6mer (University of Zagreb), Norbert Kersken\n(Herder Institute, Marburg)\nSeveral medieval chronicles, originating in the period from the tenth to the\nfifteenth century, contain the account of the founding of Ragusa (Dubrovnik).\nThese narratives, written in Ragusa and the neighbouring Dalmatian cities (Split\nand Bar) offer, at moments quite different, stories concerning the beginning of\nthe city. These stories have been much analysed by scholars, however mostly\nfrom the standpoint of the possible historical nucleus behind them. Assuming a\ndifferent standpoint, this paper\u2013\u2013premised on the conviction that the account\nof one\u2019s origin was (and still is) a tale of great political relevance\u2013\u2013seeks not to\nreveal the historical truth behind them, but to understand this delicate kind of\nmemories in the context of their own time: as narratives which served to\n(de)legitimise different political interests and to instrumentalise the city\u2019s past.\nThus, it addresses the different ways of constructing and \u201cusing\u201d the origins of\nRagusa in medieval narratives: the accounts of origins serving to provide legal\nground for institutions, such as the (arch)bishopric; origins serving to legitimise\nterritorial aspirations; origins serving to glorify and justify the aristocratic\nrepublic, and so on. However, besides these glorifying and legitimising accounts\nof origins, their constructions by the enemies of the city are also addressed,\n221Abstracts\nserving to denigrate and delegitimise Ragusan self-glorification and claims:\norigins which served to back the claim of the neighbouring kings over the city\nor those which sought to undermine the legitimacy of the Ragusan ecclesiastical\nclaims.\nThe Construction of the Image and Cult of Saint Stanislaus as a\nHoly Bishop from the Thirteenth to the Fifteenth Century\nStanislava Kuzmov\u00e1 (Slovakia)\nThesis Supervisor: G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: Stanis\u0142aw A. Sroka (Jagiellonian University, Krakow)\nSaint Stanislaus, Bishop of Cracow, lived and died in the eleventh century and\ncame to the attention of Western Christianity when he was canonised in 1253.\nOne of the images of Saint Stanislaus that the hagiography offered was that of\nan ideal bishop. This study examines this specific case in order to identify its\nrelationship to the general tendencies of episcopal sainthood established by\nother scholars. The focus was to connect the legends and the sermons that\npresented an image of a saintly bishop, changing through time, with the bishops\nwho perceived him as their model and contributed to the formation of his\nimage, a relationship that has often been taken for granted.\nThis study analyses the hagiographical works and contemporary sermons\non Saint Stanislaus, discussing the particular aspects of episcopal sainthood and\nepiscopal interests in the Polish situation in the thirteenth and the fifteenth\ncentury. The personal characteristics and description of the episcopal activities\nof Saint Stanislaus had to be constructed to a certain extent, as there were no\nauthentic sources about his life. The thirteenth-century description in the oldest\nhagiographic source, the Chronica Polonorum, was not rich, but its main tendency\nwas clear: Stanislaus was one of the martyr-bishops, a type popular after the\ncanonisation of Thomas Becket. The thirteenth-century vitae offered a picture of\na reform bishop, virtuous and ascetic, but at the same time an able administrator\nand zealous defender of the Church. In the fifteenth century the image was\nembellished, accentuating the bishop\u2019s care for both the Church and the\ncountry.\nThe image of St. Stanislaus is correlated with the bishops contemporary to\nthese sources. Bishops such as Prandota in the thirteenth century and Zbigniew\nOle\u015bnicki in the fifteenth century supported his cult. A related circumstance was\nthat these bishops had great authority in the country, often at the expense of the\n222Abstracts\nsecular rulers. The very fact that it was a bishop martyred in the conflict with a\nmember of the Piast dynasty who achieved canonisation was significant.\nThe sermons on Saint Stanislaus accentuated and spread the image of an\nideal bishop and good shepherd. Peregrinus of Opole\u2019s sermon from the turn of\nthe fourteenth century and a sample of three sermons from the fifteenth century\npresented Saint Stanislaus as an example for contemporary prelates.\nAll the sources about Saint Stanislaus presented an image of a virtuous\nprelate with great authority, although varying in the themes they accentuated in\ndifferent periods, such as the problem of Hussite heresy or the luxurious way of\nlife of prelates. This image fitted well with the bishops\u2019 concerns and interests,\nincreasing their prestige and justifying their interference in the country\u2019s social\nand political life.\nDimitrie Cantemir\u2019s Writings on Islam and the Turks:\nAn Early Modern View \u201con the Middle Ages\u201d\nAndreea M\u0103rculescu (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: Aziz Al-Azmeh, Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Andrei Pippidi (University of Bucharest)\nThe aim of this thesis is to analyse how a non-Muslim belonging to the south-\neastern European region, Demetrius Cantemir (1673\u20131723), regarded the\nOttoman Empire at the turn of the eighteenth century. Is he critical of the\nGrand Turk? And if so, what would be the perspective from which he makes\nthis critique, the reasons and the solutions which he gives in the broader\npolitical and historical context of the Orthodox Southeastern Europe of that\nage? Cantemir was familiar with the Ottoman political, social and cultural\nrealities and, to a certain extent, even sympathetic with the Ottomans as a nation\nthat was able to develop a coherent imperial order. However, he had political\nprojects which changed his attitude to ambivalence versus the Ottomans. This\nshift is not to be understood as pure political opportunism, but it is justified\nwithin a religious-eschatological framework emerging out of a militant\nOrthodox-Christian trend in which Cantemir was brought up and in which he\nbelieved. I consider his political and religious sympathies projected onto his\nbiographical background augmented by Cantemir\u2019s own treatises regarding the\nOttoman world, the Incrementa atque decrementa Aulae othomanicae, Monarchiarum\nphysica examinatio and De muhammedana religione.\n223Abstracts\nConstructing Conformity: Pastoral Care and the Role\nof Images in the Passional of Abbess Cunigund\nChristopher Montoni (United States)\nThesis Supervisor: Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: David Griffith (University of Birmingham)\nThis thesis considers the extensive program of mystical and devotional\nilluminations contained in the Passional of Abbess Cunigund, a fourteenth-century\ncodex from the convent of St. George in Prague Castle, with regard to its\nfunction as part of the cura monialium, the pastoral care of nuns. Furthermore,\nthe present study attempts to place the Passional\u2019s images in their mystical and\ndevotional context, and to consider how particular forms of Christocentric and\nMarian piety were used to guide the nuns simultaneously in their spiritual and\ncommunal obligations. In doing so, images are read in reference to the wider\n\u201cvisual culture\u201d of St. George\u2019s convent, the interpretative environment created\nby various extant textual, performative, and visual sources from the time of\nCunigund\u2019s abbacy.\nAfter placing the Passional in its historical and devotional context, a\nclarification of the manuscript\u2019s mystical orientation is offered, based on the\ncycle of De strenuo milite, a parable written by Kolda of Koldic, Dominican\nspiritual advisor to the convent. Narrative elements in the parable and\nsubsequent texts indicate that the theological basis of the Passional\u2013\u2013and by\nextension the convent during this period\u2013\u2013is to be found in the Christological\nBrautmystik of the Rhineland mystics.\nFollowing the narrative divisions of the parable, the first section of the\ncodex uses Christocentric devotional images focused on the passion narrative to\nstructure individual practices of meditation and imitation. Through these exer-\ncises, the nuns were led through the expiation of sin, after which they could\nsymbolically enact confession and communion. Thus this section is read as\ncomprising the purgative stage of mystical ascent. Marian piety defines the\nsecond and third sections of the codex, where the focus shifts to communal\nexemplification. Changing images of the Virgin provided a fitting model both\nfor communal obligations, and for identification to guide them through the\ntransformation from secular individuals to spiritual and corporate brides of\nChrist. The transformation is read as marking the illuminative stage, after which\nimages of procession lead the nuns in contemplation of their final mystical and\ninstitutional destination, the clausus paradisus of monastic segregation.\nConsideration of function inevitably raises the question of oversight and\nthe relationship between the abbess and her Dominican advisor. In addition to\n224Abstracts\nCunigund\u2019s royal secular status, the rich dedication page appears to have been\nintended to bolster the abbess\u2019s spiritual authority as well, thus leading to the\nconclusion that the codex was produced as part of a strategy of pastoral care\nguided primarily by the abbess rather than her advisor. It remains for future\nscholarship to explore more specifically the cross-currents of devotional themes,\nto determine whether the codex merely reflects larger spiritual trends, or stands\nin the forefront of image-based devotion in female convents in Central Europe\nat the beginning of the fourteenth century.\nDiscipulus quem diligebat:\nStephen Maconi and his Efforts for the\nCanonisation of Saint Catherine of Siena\nDavid Movrin (Slovenia)\nThesis Supervisor: G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: Daniel E. Bornstein (Texas A&M University)\nStephen Maconi (1350\u20131424), a disciple of Saint Catherine of Siena and later the\nprior general of the Urbanist faction of the Carthusian Order during the Great\nWestern Schism, was one of the persons responsible for the canonisation of his\nSienese spiritual mother. His role has been neglected in the literature so far; with\nthe single exception of an article by Giovanni Leoncini a decade ago, Maconi\nhas not received any serious scholarly attention.\nThe thesis builds upon the findings of previous research, reassessing and\nre-evaluating the data gathered. At the same time it builds on new primary\nmaterial, such as the recently edited Carthusian Urbanist Chartae from the period\nof the Great Schism, as well as the still unpublished archival remnants from the\nCharterhouse in \u017di\u010de, the seat of the Urbanist faction and the centre of\nMaconi\u2019s activity, or the Ljubljana Ms 12, an early copy of Raymond of Capua\u2019s\nLegenda maior with Maconi\u2019s autograph glosses.\nAll this allows a further step in the interpretation of the relationship\nbetween Stephen Maconi and Saint Catherine. Maconi appears to be the crucial\nperson among those responsible for her beatification, seemingly staying in the\nbackground yet at the same time co-ordinating the whole gamut of activities\nrelated to the promotion of her cult. What is more, his work here seems to be\nfascinatingly intertwined with his work for ecclesiastical unity, mirroring\nCatherine\u2019s own mission and reaching all the way to the pope. This topic calls\nfor further research, for which the present thesis hopefully provides a solid\nbasis.\n225Abstracts\nThe Conciliar Doctrine of Marsiglio of Padua:\nPolitical Resonances and Theological Connotations\nMartin N. Ossikovski (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisor: Piroska Nagy\nExternal Readers: Sylvain Piron (Centre de Recherches Historiques, \u00c9cole des Hautes\n\u00c9tudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris), P\u00e9ter Moln\u00e1r (ELTE, Budapest)\nThe approach towards the ecclesiastical doctrine of Marsiglio of Padua\n(1275/80\u20131342/3) as a \u201ctransposition\u201d of his secular political theory has a\ncertain tradition in Marsilian scholarship. The present study attempts to re-\nconsider this parallelism with regard to one of the chief aspects of Marsiglio\u2019s\necclesiastical theory, the doctrine about the generale concilium Christianorum, the\ngeneral council of the faithful Christians. The study\u2019s first chapter mainly\noutlines the starting problem by reviewing some basic interpretations of the\nPaduan\u2019s conciliar doctrine which consider it to be \u201cderived\u201d from a larger\npolitical context (Karl Hirsch, Alan Gewirth, Hermann Segall, Jeannine Quillet).\nThe second chapter attempts to analyse the turning points of the conciliar\ndoctrine from the point of view of Marsiglio\u2019s two most speculative texts,\nDefensor pacis (1324) and Defensor [pacis] minor (1342). The analysis focuses on the\ntwo central aspects of his conciliar idea: (i) the council\u2019s being directly assisted\nby the Holy Spirit, as had happened in Apostolic times, and (ii) its being a\ngathering, limited in terms of membership, of men proficient in matters of faith.\nOn the basis of this analysis, the third chapter returns to the opening questions\nof the study. Several conclusions are reached: firstly, Marsiglio\u2019s doctrine about\nthe general council was hardly elaborated by analogy with his secular political\ntheory; secondly, the argumentation of the conciliar thesis was, above all,\naccomplished after a series of crucial Biblical references, in the interpretation of\nwhich much speculation was introduced. Towards the end of the work, and\nfrom this corrective point of view, a reconsideration of the \u201cderivative\u201d per-\nspective of the reviewed interpretations is offered.\n226Abstracts\nAn Important Witness to the Old Slavonic Monastic Miscellanies \u2013\nKrka 4 (1346)\nStefka Pileva (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisors: Istv\u00e1n Perczel, Ralph Cleminson\nExternal Reader: Cynthia M. Vakareliyska (Oregon University)\nCodex Krka 4 (264/62) is a fourteenth-century Church Slavic manuscript,\ncontaining part of the text of the Scete Paterikon (chapters 2\u201318, omitting\nchapter 8), homilies and sermons of the Church Fathers and monastic vitae. A\nfull codicological and textological study has not been provided yet. Scholars take\nthe manuscript into consideration only when dealing with Slavonic Paterika in\ngeneral and the Scete Paterikon in particular. This thesis provides a relatively\ncomplete description of the codex in terms of both its physical features and\ncontent. Unfortunately, the manuscript has probably been lost, and the\ndescription is based on photocopies.\nCombining and interpreting the data provided by the physical description\nof the codex, its decoration, number of scribes, marginal notes, colophon and\ncontents, the thesis brings forward several hypotheses concerning some of the\ncircumstances in which the manuscript was compiled: 1. Krka 4 consists of\noriginally two distinct parts (ff. 1r\u2013224v and ff. 225r\u2013279v) which later were\nbound together, but which, nevertheless, were produced in the same monastery\nby the same monk-scribes; 2. the principal scribe of the first part was Vissarion,\nwho wrote the colophon at the end and who is responsible for the elaboration\nof the decorated initial letters in both parts; 3. the text of the Scete Paterikon is\nfound only in the first part; 4. both the first and the second parts were produced\nin the same monastery, called according to the colophon the Lavra of St.\nMichael the Archangel. The appearance of two scribes in both parts and the\nsame style of decoration testify to the unity of the codex; 5. there must have\nbeen a scriptorium in the Lavra of St. Michael the Archangel, where manuscripts\nwere produced and where traces of educational activity are to be found as well.\nThe Lavra of St. Michael the Archangel has not been identified yet, although the\nsupposition about the rock monasteries near Ivanovo sounds reasonable.\nTherefore, some of the features suggested here can be used as a clue for further\ninvestigations in defining the precise location of the monastery.\n227Abstracts\nEconomic Privileges in Transylvania:\nThe Sicklemakers\u2019 Guild from Heltau\nDaniel-Cristian Roiban (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: Katalin Szende and Bal\u00e1zs Nagy\nExternal Reader: Ian Blanchard (University of Edinburgh)\nScholars dealing mainly with urban history have found it interesting to approach\nthe history of handicrafts not only from the technological and economic view-\npoint, but also from a more social perspective, such as solidarity among\nindividuals, daily life, social care, gender, and so on. In the last decades, the\nhistory of handicrafts in Transylvania has gained a significant place within social\nand urban history. Works dealing with the history of the crafts have tended to\nbecome more specialised, and there is a strong interest in guild monographs.\nThis tendency goes hand in hand with an increased interest in the small Saxon\nsettlements.\nBetween the fifteenth and the seventeenth century the Transylvanian\nmarket reached maturity. Due to the increased competition for markets, raw\nmaterial, and fame, there was a need for special laws, namely, privileges meant\nto protect certain economic agents. The possibility that economic privileges may\nhave caused in some manner the decline of a guild, although in an initial phase\nthey had furthered the guild\u2019s development, is the main hypothesis of this thesis.\nThe case study is based on the archival material of the sicklemakers\u2019 guild from\nHeltau (a small German settlement in Transylvania). This particular guild had\ngeneral features that were common for all Transylvanian guilds and particular\nones that gave its development a peculiar course. The thesis focuses on the\nprivileges and their effect on the guild\u2019s evolution. A complex set of factors and\ncircumstances that caused the guild\u2019s extinction are also analysed.\nLate Medieval Moldavian Castles:\nFunctions, Images, Perceptions\nSabina-Lacramioara Stanila (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky, Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Readers: David Austin (University of Wales, Lampeter), Adrian Rusu (Institute\nof History of Art and Archaeology, Romanian Academy of Science, Cluj-Napoca)\nThe present study is concerned with the multifunctionality, images and percep-\ntions of late medieval Moldavian castles (from the second half of the fourteenth\n228Abstracts\nto the first half of the sixteenth century). The sample chosen is made up of the\nfollowing castles: Suceava, \u015echeia, Cetatea Neam\u0163ului, Cetatea Alb\u0103, Hotin,\nSoroca, and Tighina. The first part of the study is a description and a decon-\nstruction of the image of Moldavian castles as reflected in traditional historical\ndiscourse. It consists of individual descriptions of castles done by framing them\nin a rigid standard, that is, by using a framework consisting of the following\nparameters: location, builders and building stages, plan, type and functions. The\npurpose of these descriptions (although the information may seem at times\nbroken down and disparate) is to uncover patterns. These patterns lead, in the\nsecond part, to identifying the images and perceptions of late medieval\nMoldavian castles, that is, to see their common features and to establish possible\ndifferences in terms of the parameters that constitute the headings of each\ndescription.\nThis study indicates that a castle-building programme seems to have been\ninitiated, promoted, and carried out by Moldavian voievodes of one ruling\nhouse. This was part of the larger European framework wherein a dynasty\nconcentrated on castle building as a means of consolidating both its internal and\nexternal power. What was peculiar to medieval Moldavia, and in this sense the\nMoldavian castles do not resemble their European counterparts, is the fact that\nall of them (although it is true that they are not many) belonged to the voievode.\nThe idea of a systematic programme or policy was supported by the following\narguments: a certain location, incorporating an elevation and water as natural\ncomponents, and a commercial settlement as part of a trade route, seems to\nhave been preferred by voievodes belonging to one dynasty. A certain castle\ntype (regular square four-tower) was selected and employed rather consistently.\nThere were stages in the programme (two salient ones and another two which\nwere less important); during these stages new functions were added to castles:\nthey started mainly as fortified habitations, then the habitation turned into a\nresidence, then the residence was provided with comfort, richness, and\ndecorations and became an image of the voievodes\u2019 power and prestige.\n229Abstracts\nThe Slavonic Book of Enoch and the Secret Book of the Bogomils:\nPossible Connections and Wider Heretical Resonances in a\nSouth Slavic Context\nMilena Varzonovtseva (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisor: Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Boriana Hristova (National Library of Bulgaria, Sofia)\nThis thesis deals with the widely assumed, but rarely investigated, connection\nbetween the Slavonic Book of Enoch, or 2 Enoch, and the Secret Book of the Bogomils\nas major representatives of the main doctrinal points of the \u201cgreat heretics\u201d\u2013\u2013\nthe Bogomils. While inspecting the possible origins of such a steady concept,\nwhich puts into one coherent framework apocryphal writings and heretical\nknowledge, I turned to the earliest studies on 2 Enoch. Three theories proved to\nbe instrumental for my research: the theory of the possible influence of 2 Enoch\non the Secret Book (Sokolov), the theory of the participation of Bogomils in some\nof the redactions of 2 Enoch as copyists, who inserted Bogomil elements into the\ntext (Ivanov), and the theory of the Bogomil origin of the Slavonic Enoch\n(Maunder). My aim, considering these theories, became to investigate the\npossibilities pro and contra all these suggestions.\nIn my first chapter I presented the controversial textual history of 2 Enoch\nwith the aim of drawing a picture of the research that this text underwent: all the\npossible theories connected to its dating, place of writing, and provenance.\nFinally, I tried to present the theories which link it to the Bogomil movement in\nits existence in the First Bulgarian Kingdom. My second chapter was situated\naround the possible origins of Bogomilism, the presence of Bogomils in the\ncontext of the First Bulgarian Kingdom and the essence of their dualist beliefs\n(with concentration on their Monarchian implication). My third chapter aimed\nto inspect, on the basis of the texts of 2 Enoch and the Secret Book, whether there\nare grounds for their linkage and, if so, how they could be connected.\nOn the basis of the comparative analysis some conclusions were drawn.\nThe theory of Maunder does not appear to be tenable, because, even though 2\nEnoch shows some interesting points of relation with dualistic doctrines, it is\nnon-dualistic, with a very strong Christian element built upon a Judaic funda-\nment. Although my thesis suggests a possibility of Bogomil interference in the\ntext of the long 2 Enoch, such an interference could not serve as a strong\nargument proving a uniquely Bogomil character of 2 Enoch\u2014a text, which,\naccording to the scholarship, underwent heavy interpolation and presents\nvarious beliefs from various sources: Jewish apocalyptic lore; a strong Christian\nelement; even some Gnostic elements; finally, and indeed probably, dualistic\n230Abstracts\nincrustations in places. Some of the latter could have been inserted by a\nBogomil scribe, or perhaps the Bogomil scribe simply developed and added\ndetails to these older beliefs. Much more possible is the more modest suggestion\nthat 2 Enoch was popular in the Bogomil milieu and some details of its narrative\nalong with other apocryphal motifs were utilised by the Bogomils in their Secret\nBook.\nSorrow in Twelfth-Century Literature:\nThe Case of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes\nC\u0103t\u0103lina-Maria Veber (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: Piroska Nagy, Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Ioan P\u00e2nzaru (University of Bucharest)\nIn the romances of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes, the episodes describing the sorrow\ncaused by the loss of the beloved always seem to follow a pattern which shapes\nthe emotional behaviour of those who experience it. This study aims to focus on\nthe observation of the social component of sorrow as it appears in its literary\nrepresentation in the romances. The analysis takes into account several instanti-\nations of sorrow, and investigates both the gender and contextual distinctions.\nThe male-female opposition in the romances is based on the different manner\nof social assessments of men and women. Women do not pursue the achieve-\nment of personal goals in the public community, but within the private realm of\nlove and marriage. Female identity is defined by beauty and by their appurten-\nance to a man. In this context, the female sorrow caused by the loss of the\nbeloved is described in terms of deprivation of valor, which is attained by beauty\nand marriage. Male identity is defined within the search for public renown in the\nworld of men, which always appears in conflict with the attainment of a private\ngoal involving commitment to a woman. Men experience sorrow when they\nhave to act outside a social, that is, a public, context, or within a contradictory\none. Male sorrow emerges between personal and social concerns, from the\nimpossibility of coping with opposing values; it is described more in terms of\ninner torment while female sorrow is focused on the manifestation in the outer\nappearance. Male is spirit, female is body. At the level of the text, the sorrow\nexperienced by the people in the textual community of the romances is shaped\nby several indispensable patterns of contrast: outward vs. inward, frenzy vs.\nmadness, public vs. private, passive vs. active. The male-female opposition\nappears to be the principal opposition at work in the enactment of sorrow.\n231Abstracts\nNevertheless, the texts also allow us to observe the presence of the individual\nand the interference of male and female attitudes in the experience of sorrow.\nThe Origin of the Unus de Trinitate Controversy:\nTextual, Contextual and Metatextual Considerations\nDana-Iuliana Viezure (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Patrick Gray (York University)\nFrom a Christological perspective, the first decades of the sixth century\nrepresent a period in which the decisions taken in the Council of Chalcedon\n(451) continued to be disputed and interpreted. Different attempts were made in\nthis period to determine and expound the veritably Cyrillian character of the\ncouncil. A group of Scythian monks came to Constantinople in 518 and claimed\nthat the formula Unus de Trinitate passus est carne (Cyrillian, in its essence) should\nbe added to the formula of faith adopted in Chalcedon in order to protect the\northodoxy of the council: the Christological controversy which resulted from\ntheir initiative should be situated within the aforementioned framework.\nThere are few explicit indications in the sources concerning the origin of\nthe Scythian enterprise. Thus, any reconstruction of it will necessarily be based\non the interpretation and contextualisation of the implicit references. The most\ncommon such reconstruction in recent scholarship is that the initiative of the\nScythian monks originated in a Constantinopolitan Christological tradition. Yet\nthis interpretation is founded on the rejection of some explicit indications\nincluded in the sources, according to which the controversy originated in a\nregional Scythian context.\nStarting from the idea that the sources deserve the \u201cpresumption of\ninnocence,\u201d and that, in restoring a historical context, one should not underrate\nthe value of the ostensible nugae, this study reconstructs the regional context\nfrom different sources, going back in time until the late fourth century, and\nexamines how apparent the context in question is in the sources dated to the\nearly phase of the Scythian controversy.\n232",

They can be identified as personifi-\ncations in the sense that otherwise impalpable things receive human form.3 Since\nthe most evident and probably only device for bringing abstract ideas closer to\nthe common mind is to animate them and weave a plot around them, Sophia\nand Her Three Daughters could be concepts at the same time as they were\nsaintly women described in legends. How could they talk, act, be of different\nages and linked by family ties if they were not real persons?\nAll the same, the closer concepts come down to earth imagined as persons,\nthe more they lose their immateriality. By striving to give form to their invisible\nobject, both literary and visual representations (primarily the latter) deprive it of\nits essential unattainability.4 Much earlier in art, the influential image of a\nfrontally represented, enthroned figure already solved this problem fairly well by\ngiving limitless scope for associations.

These streams\nwere supposed to be identifiable with man\u2019s relation to the world and reality\nand, importantly, they were inherent in human psychology reflected in artworks.\nIt is easily deducible that both Kutal\u2019s conceptions (formal analysis and\nconception of two polar streams) originated from the methodological basis of\nthe Vienna School of art history.29\nKutal, however, added one more stream to the bi-polar model that,\naccording to him, arose in the middle of the fourteenth century and was defined\nby the relation to space. Non-spatiality, in terms of geometric definition, was\nsupposed to be characteristic of all Bohemian art. Precisely in this way, in the\nperiod of the Beautiful Style, \u201cthe shapes of objects separated from their\nsurroundings and space acquired a non-optical, symbolic character.\u201d30 Kutal\n28 Kutal, Socha\u0159stv\u00ed 1350\u20131450, 9. See also Bako\u0161, Kutal, 71.\n29 Bako\u0161, Kutal, 74\u201375. The origin of this perception goes back to Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (1874\u2013\n1921), and further even to Alois Riegl (1858\u20131905), both important representatives of\nthe Vienna school. It was mediated to Kutal by Vincenc Kram\u00e1\u0159 who himself studied in\nVienna. Kram\u00e1\u0159 was, together with Eugen Dost\u00e1l, Kutal\u2019s mentor and after 1919 the\ndirector of the institution that later became the National Gallery in Prague (in 1949).\n30 Kutal, Socha\u0159stv\u00ed 1350\u20131450, 73. A similar way of thinking about the role of space can\nbe found by Otto P\u00e4cht. Nevertheless, Kutal applied its understanding following\nKram\u00e1\u0159, who declared one of the specific features of the Beautiful Style to be the unreal\ncharacter of space (see Jarom\u00edr Homolka, \u201cK problematice \u010desk\u00e9 plastiky 1350\u20131450\u201d\n(On the Problematic of Bohemian Sculpture 1350\u20131450), Um\u011bn\u00ed 11 (1963): 444, note 81.\nIt was yet another Czech art historian, V\u00e1clav Mencl (1905\u20131978), who designated this\nfeature as a Bohemian specific.\n152abstracted two main\nstreams, Northern and Italian.

On the other hand, northern art had to adapt from two-dimensional to\nthree-dimensional space. The Beautiful Style was supposed to have originated\nfrom this fusion.\nAccording to P\u00e4cht\u2019s interpretation, this new style was Northern or, using\ndifferent terminology, German, which also included artistic production from\nBohemia and Austria. P\u00e4cht was sure that the form of the Beautiful Style canon\nwas possible only in German sculpture where the new linearity was merged with\nthe Italian sense of spatiality. German art might have lost its characteristic\nexpression around 1400, but that applied to only its more delicate and lyric\nversion. New types of lyric and sensual Madonnas or Piet\u00e0s of German\nprovenance may have succeeded beyond the frontiers of their origin, especially\nback in Italy, because they were made according to the principles of Italian art.\nItaly embraced this production because it drew on Italian prototypes. This was\nwhat P\u00e4cht called a typical \u201cdialogue among nations.\u201d The more aesthetic (and\nless formal) the aim was, the more it was European: \u201cUnd so lie\u00dfe sich vielleicht\nsagen, dass in dem Masse, als diese Zielsetzung eine \u00e4sthetische war, sie eine\neurop\u00e4ische zu werden vermochte.\u201d44\nHowever, the final exhibition of the artworks and their cataloguing was\ncarried out in a different, far more \u201ctraditional,\u201d way.

The\nreconstruction of the image of Symeon the Studite can also shed light to a\ncertain extent on the figures of those who wrote about him and used him as a\nmodel of spirituality, or vice versa. Accordingly, the goal of this thesis is to answer\nthe following questions: What is his image in the writings of his disciples? Why\ndid the Studite become a stumbling block for the chief court theologian,\nStephen of Nicomedia? Was the Studite a holy fool?\nThere are only a few sources from which we can obtain information about\nSymeon the Studite: a small number of his own writings, the writings of Symeon\nthe New Theologian, and the latter\u2019s Vita by Nicetas Stethatos.\nThe first chapter analyses the evidence about the Studite in the Vita of\nSymeon the New Theologian by Nicetas Stethatos. The second chapter\nexamines the collection of the New Theologian\u2019s writings. In the third chapter I\nhave carried out a threefold comparison between the monastic tradition of the\nStudios monastery, the tradition of holy folly, and the Studite. For the\ncomparative analysis I used the paradigms of Imitatio Christi and Imitatio Diogeni\nbased on Derek Krueger\u2019s investigation of the Vita of Symeon the Fool.\nThe conclusion is, first, that both Nicetas Stephatos and Symeon the New\nTheologian create an image of a modern saint as proof that the ideal of an\nabsence of passion and sanctity could still be achieved at that time. Second, I\nhave come to the conclusion that the Studite was not a holy fool, because there\nis no evidence on his part of any Imitatio Diogeni, which is a characteristic feature\nof holy fools, Third, the conflict between Symeon the New Theologian and\n259Abstracts\nStephen of Nicomedia over the commemoration of the Studite was based ab\ninitio on personal enmity between them, since they were representatives of two\ndifferent theologies. Hence, the Studite became a casus belli to attack the New\nTheologian. The secondary reason for the conflict was the process of the\nformalisation of canonisation in Byzantium at that time.\nTrade Relations between Western Europe\nand the Muslim East in the Eighth and Ninth centuries\nZulfia Fayzullina (Russian Federation)\nThesis Supervisor: Aziz Al-Azmeh\nExternal Reader: Patrick Geary (UCLA)\nInteractions between the Christian West and Muslim East after the Arab\ninvasions are an interesting but very complicated issue which has far-reaching\nimplications for a better understanding of both civilizations. Many scholars have\nworked on the problem, but because of the shortage of sources it still remains\nunexplored in many aspects. Taking one of these aspects as a research perspec-\ntive, namely economic relations between Western Europe and the Muslim East\nafter the Arab invasions, the thesis argues for the existence of intercommuni-\ncations between the Abbasid Caliphate and Frankish Kingdom at the time when\nthey reached the peak of their powers. In an attempt to achieve this purpose, I\nhave integrated the analysis of the literary sources and data of numismatic\nmaterial on the issue. Also, I correlate evidence from source materials with the\nscholarly discussion provoked by the famous work of Henry Pirenne.\nThe Holy Heat: Knightly Saints\non Transylvanian and Moldavian Stove Tiles\nAna Maria Gruia (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: Katalin Szende\nExternal Readers: Adrian Andrei Rusu (Institute of Archaeology and Art History, Cluj-\nNapoca), Elek Benk\u0151 (Institute of Archaeology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences,\nBudapest)\nStove tiles depicting knightly saints have never been studied as a group. The\nmain purpose of this study is to analyse the differences and connections in the\n260Abstracts\ndepictions of knightly saints on stove tiles in late medieval and early modern\nTransylvania and Moldavia.\nThe similarity is that in both provinces the knightly saints were regarded as\nembodiments of chivalric culture. Still, there is a difference in accent; in\nTransylvania the accent is put on the knightly values and in Moldavia on the\nsaintly attributes. I analyse the possible ways of explaining the diffusion of the\niconographic type of Ladislas on horseback and I conclude that it was trans-\nmitted from Transylvania to Moldavia. I suggest that it might have been trans-\nmitted on coins.\nThe study also discusses questions of chronological, social, and archaeo-\nlogical distributions, comparing the two Romanian provinces. It takes into con-\nsideration the possible composition of stoves, issues of workshops and copying.\nThe larger context of the study takes into consideration social, religious, and\ncultural milieus in late medieval and early modern Transylvania and Moldavia.\n\u201cNational Art Histories\u201d\nCzech, Austrian, and German Conceptions of the Beautiful Style\nSculpture\nLuba H\u00e9dlov\u00e1 (Czech Republic)\nThesis Supervisors: B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs and Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Hana Hlav\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1 (Charles University, Prague)\nThe sculpture of the Beautiful Style was a subject for different \u201cnational art\nhistories.\u201d Czech, Austrian and German scholars claimed to possess the origin,\ndevelopment, and continuity of this sculptural material in their respective artistic\nproductions. The primary assumption is that various results which were\nformulated throughout the twentieth century with the help of methods used for\ndefining the national character of art often reappear today. With the help of the\nanalysis of selected texts from the twentieth-century historiography of art as well\nas chosen examples of sculptures, the argumentation follows the continuity of\npast historiographic myths about the mutual conditionality of art and nation.\n261Abstracts\nRevisiting the Secretum: Linearity and Circularity in Petrarch\u2019s Dialogue\nZsuzsanna Kis\u00e9ry (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: Marianne S\u00e1ghy and Marcell Seb\u0151k\nExternal Reader: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u00f6r\u00e9nyi (Institute of Literary Scholarship, Hungarian Academy\nof Sciences, Budapest)\nThe Secretum is one of the most researched Latin works of Petrarch (Francesco\nPetrarca). At the same time it has provoked the most contradictory inter-\npretations. One group of scholars has applied a biographical approach, trying to\nuse the Secretum to gain information from Petrarch\u2019s text concerning his life, or,\nvice versa, trying to understand his work based on what they supposed that they\nknew about his life. They did not take into consideration the fictive character of\nthe text. The other way to approach Petrarch\u2019s work has been to treat it as\nliterature, that is, to analyze it by finding the literary context, embedding the\nwork in literary traditions.\nIt seems that one aspect of the work has also been neglected by the latter\nstudies: they have not asked the question about the purpose of the text. In my\nthesis, I offer a new and different approach to the Secretum, claiming that the\nquestion about its purpose has to be seen as fundamental. By analyzing the\nnarrative strategies of the Secretum and its possible readings, I try to answer the\nfollowing question: What kind of audience might be inferred from the text?\nAccording to the two positions of the author in the text (hiding and keeping a\ndistance), two parallel interpretations of the Secretum can be established: \u201clinear\u201d\nand \u201ccircular.\u201d Consequently, the question of reading, which is also the central\ntopic of the dialogue, should generally be interpreted in both the linear and the\ncircular way. In the linear interpretation it has a moral function, by which it can\nbe justified, while according to the circular interpretation it is an autotelic\nprocess that has its use in itself. The clash of these two contradictory inter-\npretations in the text has the function of providing a paradoxical justification of\nthe unjustifiable: that is, poetry. As for the audience, one has to infer the\nexistence of a group of intellectuals on the same cultural level as Petrarch who\nwere able to decipher the message under the integumentum, which hid (and hides)\nit from those who did (and do) not have the same cultural equipment.\n262Abstracts\nCase Studies on the Problem of the Centre and\nPeriphery in Western Christendom:\nUppsala and Spalato in the Time of Pope Alexander III (1159\u20131181)\nM\u00e1rta Kondor (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: G\u00e1bor Klaniczay and J\u00e1nos M. Bak (CEU); Endre Sashalmi\n(University of P\u00e9cs)\nExternal Reader: Piroska Nagy (Universit\u00e9 de Rouen)\nScholarship frequently applies the terms center and periphery to different parts\nof Western Christendom, but there is no consensus on exactly which lands can\nbe characterized by these terms. Since Latinitas was an expansive and internally\nchanging entity, no model can describe its inner structure throughout the whole\nMiddle Ages. Therefore, the time covered by this research was first limited to\nthe important period lasting from 1073 to 1216, and then further to the\npontificate of Alexander III (1159\u20131181).\nThe thesis aims at approaching the center-periphery problem in Western\nChristendom through two case studies. The archbishoprics of Uppsala and\nSpalato, both lying on the rim of the Latin West, were chosen as the objects of\nthe analysis. On the basis of papal letters from the time of Pope Alexander III\nthe intensity and nature of contacts between the Holy See and these \u201cfaraway\nplaces\u201d were studied. The main question addressed was what perceptions the\nRoman Curia had of these territories in the second half of the twelfth century.\nThe analysis revealed similarities as well as significant differences in the\nplace of the two archbishopric sees in Western Christendom. Compared to\ndioceses located in France or in England, the intensity of correspondence was\nconsiderably lower in both cases. Comparing them with each other, however, it\nwas discovered that different topics were dominant in the correspondence,\nwhich suggested that the papal court had a different view of the place and\nposition of these two archdioceses in Christianitas. On the Adriatic the large\nnumber of judicial cases indicates that the papacy was basically successful in\nexercising its authority there\u2014usually through legates. In the North, numerous\ncomplaints concerning the status of the Church, the non-payment of tithes or\nstill-functioning pagan customs suggest a lower level of integration into the\nChristian West. At the same time, Uppsala was considered a base for \u201cjust wars\u201d\nagainst the neighboring pagan peoples. As a consequence, on the basis of this\ncurial approach, it seems reasonable to consider Spalato as \u201csemi-periphery\u201d and\nUppsala as \u201cperiphery\u201d in the framework of the center-periphery model.\nIn my opinion, there are two main reasons lying behind the difference.\nFirst was the historical development prior to the twelfth century: The influence\n263Abstracts\nof the Roman and Frankish empires very much determined the formation and\nthe later structure of Western Christendom. Second, lying on the border of two\nrival cultural-political worlds, i.e. Byzantium and the Latin West, Spalato\u2019s geo-\npolitical position provided it with a role different from that of Uppsala (perhaps\nsimilar to that of the archbishoprics on the Iberian Peninsula). In the actual\npolitical situation this special position was emphasized and Spalato proved to be\npolitically more important for the papal court.\nAnimal History: Patterns of Authority in the Middle Ages\nAlexander Marinov (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisor: Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Luuk Houwen (Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum)\nIsidore\u2019s Etymologiae were created at the dawn of the Middle Ages and soon\nbecame widely popular and influential in various fields of knowledge. Book XII,\nDe Animalibus (On Animals), exerted its authority over the literary genres and\nnatural philosophy works on animals. One such work is the Hortus Sanitatis, the\nTractatus de Animalibus in particular, written at the end of the fifteenth century.\nInternational scholarship has dealt with both works individually and generally\nwith animal history and the transmission of authority in the Middle Ages. This\npaper aims at giving definitions of the phenomenon of authority and its trans-\nmission in the field of animal history by means of a comparative analysis of the\ntwo works. The research is carried out from the philological point of view, but\ntools of other disciplines have been borrowed in an attempt to approach the\nproblem in an interdisciplinary manner. The results of the study reflect the\ntransformation of authority through the Middle Ages. The shift towards prac-\ntically oriented and thematically specified authority in the fifteenth century from\nthe wider use of the term in Isidore\u2019s time is reflected through a general analysis\nof the authors\u2019 setting as well as with individual examples taken from the text.\n264Abstracts\nPseudo-Dionysian Excerpts in the Athonite Florilegium Iviron 281\nNadezhda Vladimirova Miladinova (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisor: Istv\u00e1n Perczel\nExternal Reader: Basile Markesinis (Catholic University, Leuven)\nThe work on my MA thesis was marked by interesting results and showed that\nworking with manuscripts can always bring unexpected outcomes. The thesis\nalso demonstrated that every manuscript, even late and fragmentary, deserves\nattention. A short report on the findings can be presented in three major points:\na new identification of the manuscript, the important consequences of this new\nidentification, and an editio princeps of several scholia to Corpus Dionysiacum.\nThe thesis examined four Pseudo-Dionysian excerpts and their hitherto\nunknown scholia. According to the catalogue description by Lambros these\nexcerpts come from an unknown anonymous fragment from the fourteenth\ncentury. The data in the catalogue permitted identifying the provenance of the\nexcerpts and, thus, provided the inventory of manuscripts of Panoplia Dogmatike\nwith one more witness.\nPanoplia Dogmatike or Dogmatic Armory is a refutation of all existing heresies,\ncomposed by Euthymius Zigab(d)enus, who was the court theologian of\nByzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus (1081\u20131118). Compiling the Panoplia,\nZigabinus included the most authoritative texts of the Church Fathers. It is not\nyet clear whether he took excerpts directly from manuscripts containing the\nwhole text of Areopagitica (the direct tradition) or derived them at second hand\nfrom earlier anthologies (the indirect tradition). Nonetheless, the collation of the\nIviron excerpts with the critical edition of Corpus Dionysiacum demonstrated that\nthe indirect tradition, as presented in the Panoplia itself, can be useful for editing\nancient texts because it may provide important variant readings not attested in\nthe main stream of the direct tradition.\nThe text of the Ivrion manuscript is not the same as the edited Panoplia. It\ncontains less and more. Many of the edited texts are missing in the fragment,\nwhile the latter\u2019s text is different in many respects. In the case of the Dionysian\nfragments treated here, while the edited text contains some variants against the\nIviron fragment (or vice versa), the main difference is the commentaries, of\nwhich, as far as I can judge, this thesis presents the editio princeps.\nThe research showed that these commentaries are older than the Pseudo-\nDionysian text in the manuscript and, independent of the variant readings in the\nmain text, witness a different stage of text transmission. In other words, the\ncommentaries do not comment on the text in the manuscript but on a different\nand earlier version. The analysis established that their source is Ambigua ad\n265Abstracts\nThomam written by Saint Maximus the Confessor during the Monothelite\ncontroversy in the seventh century.\nBased on Saint Maximus\u2019 commentaries on the Areopagite, the commen-\ntaries in the Iviron manuscript seem to comment on already-existing commen-\ntaries. These commentaries were the main focus of the study, or to put it in\nother words, volens-nolens the thesis itself became included in the chain of succes-\nsive interpretation of the Corpus Dionysacum. It also showed how important a\ncritical edition of Zigadenus\u2019 Panoplia Dogmatica would prove to be not only for\nByzantine but also for Patristic studies.\nThe Margery Kempe of the 1990s. A Microhistoriography\nLidia Negoi (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00e1nos M. Bak\nExternal Reader: Grethe Jacobsen (Royal Library, Copenhagen)\nThe Book of Margery Kempe has been the object of controversial debate since its\ndiscovery in 1940. The first autobiography in English, the history of this work\nwritten by a fifteenth-century laywoman is not only a token of the religiosity at\nthe end of the Middle Ages, but also presents an interesting case of how\ntwentieth-century historiographical discourse uses and perceives the past.\nThis essay focuses on 1990s narratives on The Book of Margery Kempe in\nAnglophone historiography, more specifically on a certain volume of essays,\nMargery Kempe. A Book of Essays, edited by Sandra McEntire in 1992. Connecting\nthe items with other studies on Margery Kempe, the image revealed by this\ndiscourse is that of a Margery Kempe who corresponds and answers rather to\nthe needs of the postmodern time than to the fifteenth century.\nA Latin Rhyming Decalogue in Fifteenth-Century Central Europe.\nTextual Analysis in an Intellectual Context\nAndr\u00e1s N\u00e9meth (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Veszpr\u00e9my\nExternal Reader: Edit Madas (Fragmenta Codicum Research Group, Hungarian of\nAcademy of Sciences)\nThe thesis provides a critical edition and investigation of a late medieval text, a\nLatin rhyming version of the Ten Commandments, a significant topic in the late\n266Abstracts\nmedieval period. The Decalogue became a basic text after the introduction of\nobligatory annual confession in 1215. From then on it was a significant element\nof the catechism, education, and preaching. This thesis summarises these fields,\nemphasising the role of didactic poems in medieval schooling with the example\nof the Decalogue and the Esztergom Cathedral School.\nThe text is a didactic summary of the Ten Commandments expanded with\nadditional teaching of the catechism. Originally it was composed at the end of\nthe fourteenth century for educational purposes, probably by Florian Mokrski,\nthe first rector of the University of Cracow. The evidence of the manuscripts\ntestifies that monastic and cathedral schools used this rhyming Decalogue text\nfor educational purpose and monks and secular priests used it for preaching on\nvirtues and vices.\nThis rhyming Decalogue has been preserved in ten codices in Central\nEurope. The description of these codices reveals the different users of the\npoem. The edition of the text, based on eight manuscripts, intends to combine\nthe advantages of the classical way of editing texts and the concept of New\nPhilology and to avoid the disadvantages of both approaches. A textual\ncommentary following the edition analyses the variants of the manuscripts. The\nmultiple approach in investigating the text provides a strong basis for locating it\nin the intellectual life of fifteenth-century Central Europe.\nThe Perceptions of the Kingdom of Hungary in\nThirteenth-Century English Sources\nZsuzsanna M\u00e1ria Papp (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky\nExternal Reader: Martyn Rady (School of Slavonic and East European Studies,\nUniversity College London)\nThere is an immense amount of literature on national stereotypes, \u201cthe image of\nthe other,\u201d perceptions, and other similar interdisciplinary fields and much of it\nis concerned with medieval material. My thesis deals with a less often analysed\nsegment of the palette: the perceptions of Hungary in England as reflected in\nthe contemporary written sources by thirteenth-century Englishmen. The\npurpose of this paper was to discover whether there was a pool of data available\nfor English literates in the thirteenth century consistent enough to form specific\nstereotypes of the country and its people or whether their ideas about Hungary\nwere vague and stereotypical as one of the frontier countries far-off overseas.\n267Abstracts\nThe thesis argues that the references found in contemporary sources can\nbe divided into two distinct groups: records of indirect information (where the\nauthor has no first-hand knowledge about Hungary) and evidence of direct\ncontact. Whereas my working hypothesis, that the cataclysm of the Mongol\ninvasion brought about the increase in frequency and depth of information\nabout Hungary, was demonstrated in the case of indirect information, in the\ncase of records of direct contacts a reverse tendency was found, which, in turn,\ncan be explained with the contrary effects of the Mongol invasion.\nThe sources were peculiar with regard to the study of perceptions. On one\nhand, indirect records which could transmit the perceptions of their author have\nhardly any factual information about Hungary. On the other hand, those\ndocuments which reveal a profound knowledge about the country, the formal\nofficial letters, leave no room for the author\u2019s perceptions.\nThe other observation concerning the distribution of references across\nboth types of sources was that there was no thematic overlap between the two\ngroups. The segment of the literate society that had access to first-hand infor-\nmation about Hungary was a very limited circle and apparently had no contact\nwith the rest of the intellectuals. The conclusion concerning the perceptions of\nHungary is that the available information was generally not sufficient to form\nconsistent perceptions among thirteenth-century English literates.\nSanctifying Virtues: Saint Sophia and Her Daughters,\nTheir Image, and Their Role in Late Medieval Hungary\nJudit Seb\u0151 (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisrors: B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs and Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Barbara Newman (Northwestern University, Evanston, Il.)\nThe representation of Saint Sophia with Her Three Daughters appears on a\ngreat number of late medieval altarpieces from Little Poland and the former\nUpper Hungary. It was revealed that these four figures, who are the\npersonifications of Divine Wisdom, Faith, Hope, and Charity, began to be\nvenerated as saints in the early Middle Ages and had a cult place in Alsace. The\nspecific type of composition in which they were depicted in most cases was\nprobably developed in Poland at the turn of the fourteenth century. It resembles\nthe iconography of Saint Anne with Mary and the Child and of other enthroned\nfigures. In this study, I discuss the origins of this group of saints, who have an\nintermediary status between Byzantine and Western cultures, and the beginnings\nof their cult in the early fifteenth century. I compare their representations to\n268Abstracts\nearlier ones, such as Sapientia enthroned, and explain their roles as holy helpers\nin need and an exemplary mother and virgins, focusing on the Hungarian\nevidence.\nThe Meaning and Use of Bullae in Late Classical Pannonia in Their\nImperial Context\nMagdolna Szil\u00e1gyi (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: Alice Choyke\nExternal Reader: Paula Zsidi (Aquincum Museum, Budapest)\nThe aim of this thesis is to make a comprehensive analysis of bullae, the globular\namulet capsules of the Romans, and their use in Pannonia with special regard to\nAquincum. I use three types of sources in the thesis: 1) the actual surviving\nobjects, 2) their represenattions on statues, reliefs, and paintings, and 3) written\nsources mentioning the bulla in various contexts. Each of these three sources\nreveals different aspects of how the bulla was used by the Romans. The\nquestions I attempt to answer in the thesis are: What are the characteristics of\nbullae made in Pannonia, and are they different from those made in other\nprovinces of the Roman Empire? Who did the bulla belong to? Is it possible to\npoint out patterns in the use of the bulla in different periods? To aid in\nanswering these questions I have prepared a catalogue of Pannonian bullae, a\ncatalogue and a database of graves, and also a list of Classical texts mentioning\nbullae with an English translation for each passage. Having evaluated the\navailable data, I found that bullae were used as markers of social status, age, and\nmaterial status, and also they had an apotropaic function throughout the Roman\nEmpire. From these in Late Roman Pannonia, the amuletic function of the bulla\nseems to have been the most characteristic.\nBorrowed Images: Classical Imagery on the Christian Floor Mosaics at\nStobi from the Fourth to the Sixth Century\nAnita Vasilkova (Macedonia)\nThesis Supervisor: Marianne S\u00e1ghy\nExternal Reader: \u00c1rp\u00e1d Nagy (Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest)\nMosaic pavements comprise a major corpus of archaeological finds at Stobi,\nMacedonia, in the period from the second half of the fourth century to the\n269Abstracts\nsecond half of the sixth century AD. They are found in secular buildings\n(luxurious houses) and basilicas and most of them are well preserved. All the\nmosaics belong to early Christian art and most scholars have considered them in\nthe framework of the art of that period.\nThis thesis argues that the widely accepted opinion that early Christian art\nwas partially made from \u201cpagan\u201d imagery can be seen in the mosaics from Stobi.\nThis problem is approached in three ways: 1) the decoration is treated as simple\nobjects of art and analogies with other examples are made, especially with neigh-\nboring archaeological sites; 2) the mosaics are put into a social context (work-\nshop, public, and religious life); and 3) stylistic developments in the mosaics are\ncontextualized in the general stylistic development of early Christian art and\nelements of local influence.\nMartyr and Knight:\nthe Cult of St. Anastasia and of St. Chrysogonus in Medieval Zadar\nTrpimir Vedri\u0161 (Croatia)\nThesis Supervisor: Marianne S\u00e1ghy\nExternal Reader: Claire Sotinel (Universit\u00e9 Michel Montaigne de Bordeaux)\nThis work inquires into the making of a cult of the two principal patron saints\nof Zadar, a Dalmatian city, between the ninth and the fourteenth centuries.\nAfter clarifying the obscure history of the cults before their introduction into\nZadar, I point to some issues from the town\u2019s history such as an unbroken\ntradition of urban living since antiquity and the importance of the bishop in the\nEarly Middle Ages. With the later fragmentation of the spiritual and secular\nauthority, the monastery of St. Chrysogonus came to play a major political role,\nits abbots opposing the authority of the archbishops of Zadar and actively par-\nticipating in the resistance to Venice. All these tensions found their expression\nin devotion to the patron saints of the communities in conflict. While the cult of\nSt. Anastasia, venerated in the city cathedral, was much more important in the\nearly Middle Ages, the cult of St. Chrysogonus came to play an important role in\ncity politics only with the growing power of the monastery in the High Middle\nAges. Venerated in the early period as a monk, Chrysogonus came to be repre-\nsented as a knight, whose image as a charging horseman came to symbolise the\npride and self-confidence of the commune of Zadar. With the upgrading of the\nbishopric to the archbishopric level in the mid-twelfth century, the position\ncame under the strong influence of Venice, leading eventually to the introduc-\ntion of Venetian bishops in the following centuries. At the same time, the\n270Abstracts\nmonastery developed strong relations with the Croatian and Hungarian court,\nbecoming the political power known as the \u201cking\u2019s party\u201d in Zadar. The aim of\nthe research is to show how the cults of St. Anastasia and of St. Chrysogonus\nreflected these tensions, and how the social and political circumstances led to\nthe replacement of the city\u2019s principal patron saint, St. Anastasia, and established\nSt. Chrysogonus as the new principal patron of the commune.\n271abstract of this dissertation is published in the annual of Szeged\nUniversity: Chronica 5 (2005) (forthcoming).\nThe Fate of the Croatian Noble Families in the Face of Ottoman Advance\nIvan Jurkovi\u0107 (Croatia)\nThe Examination Committee at the public defense on 9 March, 2004, consisted\nof M\u00e1ria Kov\u00e1cs (CEU, Nationalism Studies Program), chair; J\u00e1nos M.

Although this description does not appear in d\u2019Ablis\u2019 record as\noften as in that of Fournier, many individuals summoned in Carcassonne spoke\nabout the boni homines in a similar way.54 However, they were more often\nrequired to answer a different kind of question:\nInterrogata si audivit loqui ipsos hereticos aliquid contra ecclesiam Romanam vel\nfidem catholicam de sacramentis ecclesiasticis, videlicet de baptismo, de\nmatrimonio, de sacrificio misse seu corpore Christi vel de quibuscumque aliis que\nsunt contra fidem ecclesie Romane\u202655\nIn the tribunal of Carcassonne, this question had a central role among\nthose about the content of heretical preaching. The rejection of the Catholic\nfaith was ascertained by referring to the denial of the pillars of the Latin Church,\nthe sacraments. How did the accused reply to this question? Once more, the\nrecorded answers have a repetitive feature. The accused follow step by step the\nformulation of the question, and reply referring to the Cathar critique of every\nsingle sacrament. As a consequence, these depositions are characterised by an\nobstinate repetition of the same arguments.\nIn addition, the examination on important tenets of the Cathar belief rarely\nappears d\u2019Ablis\u2019 register. The inquisitor of Carcassonne, so to speak, approached\nthe heretical doctrine from a negative perspective, being interested in what of\nthe Catholic Church the boni homines sought to deny, rather than in what they\npositively stated. In order to identify heresy, the main perspective was indicated\nby the true doctrine rather than by the errores manichaeorum.\nThe attitude of Jacques Fournier was quite different. The bishop of\nPamiers regarded the investigation of doctrine as an essential part of the process\ndealing with heresy. He was noticeably concerned to discover which tenets the\naccused had heard during the preaching and which of them he believed in. As\nan excerpt from the process of Bernard Marty de Junac shows, Fournier led his\ninterrogations on the basis of a more articulated questionnaire:\nInterrogatus si tunc vel ex tunc credidit dictos errores, scilicet quod dicti eretici\nessent boni homines et sancti, et quod salvabant animas vel iuvabant ad\nsalvandum ipsas, et quod nullus poterat salvari nisi in fide eorum, et quod nullus\n54 See also Geoffroy d\u2019Ablis, 292: \u201cipsi non jurabant nec menciebantur nec faciebant\nmalum homini et talem vitam ducebant.\u201d Moreover, see Geoffroy d\u2019Ablis, 250: \u201cEt\ndicebant quod ipsi faciebant magnas abstinencias et faciebant tres quadragesimas in\nanno et quod habebant potestatem salvandi animas.\u201d\n55 Geoffroy d\u2019Ablis, 228; see also 251, 262, 293, 334.\n63abstractly as a list because this is\nbraided history with sleeves rolled up. Natalie brings the same phenomenal\nenergy and curiosity to finding out things as to intertwining what she finds,\nlooking for the fit. It\u2019s as if there should be or, better, that there must be a\n212abstracts\u2014as usual\u2014can be found in this volume.\nEven after this late June event there were academic programs connected to\nthe Department of Medieval Studies, namely two important Summer University\ncourses, one of them on \u201cBookish Traditions: Authority and the Book in Scriptur-\nalist Religions,\u201d and the other on \u201cConflict and the Law in Medieval Europe.\u201d\nLet me finish this report with a short but very personal remark. After all\nthis academically important and, from the educational point of view interesting,\nprogram, for the author of this report the most remarkable event of the year\nwas a summer event. The surprise party organized with strong cooperation of\nfaculty members and my family indeed was the most successful preparation for\nmy mystical journey to the unknown land of the \u201cGreat Sabbatical.\u201d\n275ABSTRACTS\nFlorentine Merchants in Hungary during the Reign of King Sigismund \u2013\nEconomic and Social Strategies\nKrisztina Arany (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: Bal\u00e1zs Nagy, Katalin Szende\nExternal Readers: P\u00e9ter E. Kov\u00e1cs (Hungarian Academy, Rome), Zsuzsanna Teke\n(Institute of History of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest)\nThe thesis is dedicated to a survey of Florentine businessmen\u2019s economic and\nsocial strategies in the Hungarian Kingdom during the reign of King Sigismund\n(1387\u20131437). Their possibilities have been explored through a quantitative\nanalysis of a prosopographic database and with the help of detailed case studies.\nA relatively balanced participation and the continuing presence of sub-\nsequent generations of Florentine families can be observed in the administration\nof various royal incomes. This prevalence is reflected in the choices of Floren-\ntines who settled in urban society since most of the Hungarian towns they chose\nwere also administrative seats. Buda\u2019s role as royal seat and constant residence\nhas to be emphasized. Besides these economic factors also the personal influ-\nence of Filippo Scolari attracted other Florentines into Hungary.\nBased on the data of the Florentine Catasto, I surveyed the Florentine\neconomic and social background of two Florentine companies settled in Buda in\nthe early fifteenth century. In the cases of the two successful companies I found\nalmost all the typical business fields of the Florentines working in the kingdom.\nI had the entire Catasto list of the Hungarian affairs of Melanesi company at my\ndisposal; the brothers mainly worked together with Florentine fellow-\ncountrymen. The lists also contributed to the identification of some non-\nFlorentine business partners of the Melanesi brothers in Hungary. I contrasted\nthe less successful attempt of a third case, the Corsini brothers, with their\nexamples. In their case, besides the lack of capital, the unfavorable timing of\ntheir appearance in Hungary also contributed to their failure.\n277Abstracts\nZoocephalic Figures in the Tripartite Mahzor\nZs\u00f3fia Buda (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: Gerhard Jaritz, Johannes Niehoff-Panagiotidis\nExternal Readers: Judith Baskin (University of Albany), Marc Michael Epstein\n(Vassar College, New York)\nAnimal-headed figures often appeared in Ashkenazi Jewish liturgical books in\nsouthern and central Germany from the second third of the thirteenth to the\nmiddle of the fourteenth century. Scholars who have dealt with this phenom-\nenon have considered it, on the one hand, a method to avoid the visual\nrepresentation of a human being for theological reasons, and, on the other hand,\nas an anti-Semitic sign taken over from Christian art.\nThe use of animal-headed figures seems to have followed various patterns\nfrom manuscript to manuscript. Therefore, it is necessary to examine each book\nand then draw a conclusion concerning the whole group. The Tripartite Mahzor\nshows a tendency to depict women with animal heads and men with human\nheads. This thesis is an attempt to explore the background of this pattern of the\nvisual distinction of genders by studying the religious and gender discourse of\nthe Jewish tradition.\nThe first chapter describes the images of the Mahzor, focusing on the\nzoocephalic depictions. The second chapter examines Jewish written sources on\nthe problem of seeing, the face, and the visual representation of a human being.\nTwo types of writings are discussed: rabbinical literature and the writings of the\nGerman pietistic movement, the Hasidei Ashkenaz, chiefly their main ethical\nwriting, the so-called Sefer Hasidim. The third chapter analyses the visual parallels\nof the Mahzor, pointing out the differences in the use of the zoocephalic motif.\nThe last chapter discusses the possible relationships between the images\nand the written sources. The conclusion is that the distinction according to\ngender in the Tripartite Mahzor may be connected to similar concepts of Jewish\ntradition. Especially the ideas of the Hasidei Ashkenaz concerning women may\nhave had some role in the formation of the spiritual context of the illumination\nof the Mahzor.\n278Abstracts\nTwo Inquisitors of the Declining Catharism\nIrene Bueno (Italy)\nThesis Supervisor: G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: Carol Lansing (University of California Santa Barbara)\nThe inquisition registers of Geoffroy d\u2019Ablis (Carcassonne, 1308\u20131309) and\nJacques Fournier (Pamiers, 1318\u20131325) were produced in the context of the last\npersecutions of Catharism in Languedoc. Scholars have studied these records\nmostly from ethnographic, anthropological, socio-economic, and religious per-\nspectives. The aim of my research is to enquire into the inquisitorial activity of\nd\u2019Ablis and Fournier through a comparative analysis of their registers. What are\nthe main dissimilarities between the two sources? How are they to be situated in\nthe historical context? Do they reveal characteristics of a personal interpretation\nof the inquisitorial role?\nAfter discussing the historical evolution of inquisitorial documents, I\ncarried out a comparison of inquisitorial procedures, analyzing the construction\nof the inquest, the summoning of witnesses and the accused, and the various\nphases of the process. Secondly, through the dissection of the questions asked\nby the inquisitors in the course of interrogations, I have reconstructed the ques-\ntionnaires employed in the two courts.\nThe procedures leading from accusation to abjure are generally similar,\nalthough Fournier\u2019s activity was characterised by a more articulated phase of\ninvestigation, a greater use of preventive imprisonment, and a more direct\nparticipation in the lawsuits. Relevant differences were noted regarding the ques-\ntionnaire, especially concerning questions of belief and the way of registering\nanswers. Differences may be related to the different attitudes of the Dominican\nd\u2019Ablis and the Cistercian bishop-inquisitor Fournier, each in charge of fighting\nagainst heresy in jurisdictional areas of different sizes. The two inquisitors each\nplayed a different historical role in the demise of Catharism: Jacques Fournier\ninherited the success of the campaigns of d\u2019Ablis and Bernard Gui, which had\nled to the imprisonment of most of the perfecti, and completed their mission with\na new technique of interrogation.\n279Abstracts\nThe Hussites, Orthodox, and Catholics in the Moldavian Context:\nA Unique Case of Conviventia in Fifteenth-Century Europe\nCristian-Nicolae Daniel (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: G\u00e1bor Klaniczay, Marcell Seb\u0151k\nExternal Reader: Maria Cr\u0103ciun (Babe\u015f-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca)\nThe presence of the Hussites in a largely Orthodox country constitutes a unique\nand intriguing case in fifteenth-century Europe. The historiographers of the\nHussites in Moldavia have analysed the primary sources separately from those\non other religious groups, and thus missed a general, yet still detailed, picture.\nAn overview of the historiography shows more interest in the Peasant War of\n1437 in Transylvania and its uncertain links with the Hussite \u201crevolution\u201d than\nin the Hussites in Moldavia. A few studies have also been dedicated to the\ndoctrinal programs of the Hussites in Moldavia and Transylvania, while the\ninteraction between Orthodox and Hussites in Moldavia has been but briefly\nanalysed.\nThe aim of this thesis is then to find out what made Moldavia an attractive\nplace for the Hussites to come to. The study of the interaction of the secular\nand religious policies of the rulers in the region and the analysis of the doctrinal\nprograms and structure of the Hussite communities brought together infor-\nmation on attitudes of the Hussites towards others and themselves.\nA comparative analysis of institutions, policies, and doctrines constitutes\nan important part of the thesis. I compared the confessional landscape of Tran-\nsylvania and Moldavia because it influenced the choice of the Hussites. The\ndoctrinal programs of the Hussites in Transylvania and Moldavia were com-\npared in order to establish their affiliation to one of the Hussite factions, and\nalso to check their differences and common points. The policy of Alexander the\nGood, Prince of Moldavia, was compared with that of neighbouring rulers in\norder to establish the impact of the international background on the coming of\nthe Hussites to Moldavia.\nThe thesis argues that Moldavia was a better place for Hussites to be than\nany other country in the region. This was due to several factors: the policy of the\nruler, the attitude of the Orthodox Church, the conflict between the Catholic\nbishops and the Mendicants, and the acceptance by the local Catholic\npopulation of the Hussite message. The Hussite community in Moldavia was a\nlively one; it was protected by the ruler, proselitysed among the locals, produced\nthe first Bible in Hungarian, and continued to do missions in neighbouring\nTransylvania and the Balkans. All of this happened in Moldavia without any\nkind of organised repression. Their presence offered a rare case of conviventia\n280Abstracts\nbetween Hussites, Orthodox, Catholics, and Monophysites, which remained\nunparalleled in fifteenth-century Europe.\nThe Economic History of the Cistercian Monastery in Toplica \u2013\nA Topographic Approach\nL\u00e1szl\u00f3 Ferenczi (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky\nExternal Readers: C. James Bond (Independent Scholar), Beatrix F. Romh\u00e1nyi\n(Budapest History Museum)\nThe estate complex of the Cistercian abbey of Toplica, founded in 1211 by King\nAndrew II, was one of the largest and most significant in medieval Hungary.\nThe history of the abbey has been discussed only superficially so far, but the\narchival documents collected now in a considerable number enabled a detailed\nreconstruction of the economic history of the monastery.\nThe thesis aims at investigating the Toplica estate within a comparative\nframework, applying a topographic approach. On the basis of the foundation\ncharter, previously suggested locations for the place names mentioned in the\ndocuments have been revised. Concerning the settlement pattern of the estate,\nspecial attention was paid to the problem of the internal hierarchy of the\nCistercian possessions and to the practice of a mixed economy, analysing the\ntopographical features of the estate (trade routes, market towns, market places,\ngranges, mills). Following a different thread, the social connections of the\ncommunity\u2019s history have also been approached with the help of those charters\nwhich documented the land acquisitions of the monastery or land transfers on\nbehalf of lay people or ecclesiastics.\nThe analysis revealed that the economy of the monastery was probably the\nmost prosperous around the second half of the thirteenth and the first half of\nthe fourteenth century. This was the time when new landed properties were\nacquired. These acquisitions, as a sign of social support, however, seem to have\nplayed a limited role in forming the monastic estate. This trend was clearly\napparent when comparing Hungarian and Polish examples. In terms of com-\nmercial activity, the trade route along the Una River, and a warehouse in the\ntown of Senj (Zengg, Segnia) on the Adriatic coast could have been of primary\nimportance for the abbey. The close topographical relation between settlements\nand granges and central places suggests that the community played a productive\nrole in the secondary economy.\n281Abstracts\nFrom the 1330s on, Toplica started to lease some of its estates to various\nlay and religious persons, which remained a continuous tendency until the end\nof its history in the sixteenth century. According to these contracts, there were\nclose contacts between the community and the Zagreb chapter, the Blinai/\nB\u00e1tmonostori family, and the Blagay family, who all played leading roles as\nfactors of local policy. A considerable number of charters attest that the abbey\nalso established another type of social clientele by donating lands to lesser\nnobles for their service.\nSt. Germanos, Patriarch of Constantinople,\nin Georgian Translated Sources:\nThe Homily on the Cross and Icons\nNatia Gabrichidze (Georgia)\nThesis Supervisor: Johannes Niehoff-Panagiotidis\nExternal Reader: Zaza Skhirtladze (Tbilisi State University, Georgia)\nThis thesis aims to provide scholarship with evidence on St. Germanos I,\npatriarch of Constantinople, from Georgian translated sources. The authorship\nand authenticity of the writings attributed or ascribed to this famous patriarch\nremain problematic. In my work I propose to use \u201cindirect\u201d sources, namely\nGeorgian translated texts, for establishing St. Germanos\u2019 legacy. My aim is to\ndemonstrate that these translations indeed contain significant rare data and are\nuseful for this purpose.\nIn the first part of the thesis I describe and to a certain extent evaluate the\nGeorgian translated sources on St. Germanos I, provide data about the manu-\nscripts and, if possible, about the translators as well. The first chapter is\nintended to show the complete picture of the extant Georgian material. Appar-\nently the translations were compiled by skillful and well-educated Georgian\ntranslators in Georgian scholarly centers and translation schools at the monas-\nteries of Iviron (Mount Athos) and Black Mountain (Syria). Their translation\nprinciples and theories and the fact that they had access to all the dictionaries\nand original sources of that time allows me to evaluate their translated\nproduction as valuable and considerable sources. The texts are mostly preserved\nin eleventh- or twelfth-century manuscripts. I think that this data should be\ntaken into account as any kind of information from the eleventh century, even\nfalse, can serve as an argument for the final conclusions concerning the\nauthorship and authenticity of particular texts.\n282Abstracts\nIn the second part I analyze one of these sources, namely the Homily on the\nCross and Icons, which is preserved only in Georgian translation. I tried to situate\nthe text at the center of intense contextualization, in other words, to examine\nthe treatise as a single episode from multiple perspectives and thus investigate\nthe reasons for its emergence, purpose, and function in both the Byzantine and\nGeorgian realities. In the second chapter I tried to find a proper methodology\nfor further research, as one of the crucial questions is what methodology should\nbe applied to both original and translated sources. It was clear in the second part\nof my work that only historical or even literary studies have not helped me to\ndetermine its author or authenticity.\nI think that only careful, accurate, and thorough linguistic analysis will\nenable scholars to arrive at any definite conclusion. It will be possible to achieve\nresults only after researching the author\u2019s language, style, terminology, rhetorical\ndevices, allegories, and metaphors. Linguistic analysis of the text will be im-\npossible, however, without clarifying the text tradition. Only very little of\nGermanos\u2019 literary legacy has been critically edited and published. Therefore, the\nfirst step on this path, in my opinion, is the investigation of the transmission\nand history of the texts, including all the extant manuscripts and the recon-\nstruction of their more or less \u201cgenuine\u201d core. My final conclusion is that the\nonly way out of the impasse of establishing St. Germanos\u2019 legacy is first of all\ncritical editions of all the extant sources, both original and translated, second,\ntheir thorough linguistic analysis, and finally, historical study.\nImages of King and Court in The Book of States by Don Juan Manuel\nand The Poem of Palace Life by Pedro Lopez de Ayala\nIrina Kaliteevskaia (Russian Federation)\nThesis Supervisor: Johannes Niehoff-Panagiotidis\nExternal Reader: Istv\u00e1n R\u00e1k\u00f3czi (E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest)\nIn the Late Middle Ages in Castile, as elsewhere in Europe, the form of the royal\ncourt was evolving. This process was closely connected with the strengthening\nof royal power and changes in the image of the king. The aim of the thesis is to\nexamine the correlation between the image of the king and the court in didactic\nworks of Castilian writers of the fourteenth century. The research is based on\nthe works of writers involved in the political life of Castile who had personal\ncontact with the Castilian rulers. The main sources are The Book of States by Don\nJuan Manuel and The Poem of Palace Life by Pedro Lopez de Ayala. The Book of\nExamples by Don Juan Manuel, Glosses of Wisdom or Moral Proverbs by Santob de\n283Abstracts\nCarri\u00f3n, and the chronicles of Pedro Lopez de Ayala are also used for\ncomparisons.\nThe texts are read both as representations of the notions of their authors\nand as a means of constructing the images that had a particular effect on their\ncontemporaries. Don Juan Manuel regarded the king as one of the great lords in\nthe hierarchy of the vassal state; thus, his court did not differ from the house-\nhold of any other noble person. The main function of Lopez de Ayala\u2019s king\nwas to preserve peace and harmony in the kingdom, which puts him much\nhigher than and separates him from the other lords. His court thus becomes a\nspecial society invested with the power that comes from the fact of proximity to\nthe king.\nThe thesis demonstrates that the image of the ruler represented in the\nliterary work influenced the image of the court. In the works of Don Juan\nManuel and Pedro Lopez de Ayala the differences between the idea of kingship\nand the real and proposed qualities of the court show that a transformation was\ngoing on in the fourteenth century and allows the indication of some paradigms\nof this evolution.\nPersonal Name Patterns in Medieval Winchester\n(Tenth to Fourteenth Century): Social and Linguistic Approaches\nOlga Khotskina (Russian Federation)\nThesis Supervisor: Katalin Szende\nExternal Reader: Derek Keene (Centre for Metropolitan History, Institute of Historical\nResearch, London)\nThe question of the appearance of specific personal names has always captured\nthe minds of scholars. This work presents an insight into the world of\nfirst/given names from Winchester in the tenth to fourteenth century. It aims to\ncombine socio-historical and linguistic methods in analysing the personal name\nmaterial of the Biographical Register of the Survey of Medieval Winchester.\nMy sample included 1717 individuals from approximately 5000 people in\nthe Register from the tenth to fourteenth century. After a general presentation\nof the material, I tried to characterise the personal names from a social point of\nview and to establish a chronological evolution of various influences affecting\nthe appearance, popularity, and/or disappearance of forenames. I also discuss\nthe difference between the female and male name corpus, as well as the ethnic\nand occupational characteristics of my sample. The thesis also includes a case\nstudy on the Arthurian influence and small-scale research on family trees. The\n284Abstracts\nother approach to the forenames is from the linguistic perspective, focusing on\nthe etymology, semantics and structure of the selected data.\nAs one of the results of my work I demonstrate the gradual process of the\nchanges in the forename corpus from the Old English period through the\nAnglo-Saxon and Continental Germanic to the strong domination of Biblical/\nChristian examples in the later periods. Consideration of the female and male\nsystems showed the difference in the name choice peculiar to each of them. The\nArthurian case study pointed at the importance of fashion in the name choice,\nespecially in the later centuries, inspired by the development of the Arthurian\nliterature and Winchester\u2019s role in this connection.\nPerception of the \u201cOther\u201d and its Stereotypes: Lithuania in the\nDescriptions of the Fifteenth and the First Half of the Sixteenth Centuries\nAlena Kliuchnik (Belarus)\nThesis Supervisor: Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Felicitas Schmieder (FernUniversit\u00e4t Hagen)\nParticularities of perception of the \u201cother\u201d and its stereotypes are an essential\ncompound of the discourse about other lands. The object of investigation in this\nthesis is the image of Lithuania as described in Western European written\nsources in the Late Middle Ages, a period of great interest and numerous\naccounts about other countries. This research is the first step in tracing the\nimage of Lithuania in the West through the study period, how it was formed,\nand how it evolved. Two main groups of written sources provide the principal\ndata here. The first group are so-called cosmographies and geographies and the\nsecond group comprises travel accounts. Images and the cartographic data help\nto demonstrate the way stereotypes were applied and spread on the visual level.\nThe analysis of the image created of Lithuania demonstrates that cultural,\nmoral, and religious issues were the criteria used to emphasise its \u201cotherness.\u201d\nThe description of Lithuania by Aeneas Silvius Piccolomini appears to have\nbeen the most influential in the whole study period. Through the practice of\ncopying it can be traced practically unchanged in all later Western European\ncosmographies and geographies, thus shaping stereotypes and the pattern of the\nimage of Lithuania. The travel accounts by Sigmund Herberstein are the apogee\nof sources by an eyewitness. The analysis showed that this later description was\nalso influenced by the image of Lithuania created by geographers and cosmog-\nraphers.\n285Abstracts\nThe main conclusion of the investigation is that the image of Lithuania\nseen in the investigated sources remained firm and relatively stable and became\na kind of stereotype itself. This is partly explained by minimal information about\nit in the West. At the same time, the image created corresponded to particular-\nities of historical religious-cultural understanding of \u201cotherness\u201d in the West.\nThe topic has good potential for further investigation in the context of\ncomparing the image of Lithuania with images of the previous period or with\nneighbouring lands.\nThe Uncrowned Lion:\nRank, Status, and Identity of the Last Cilli\nRobert Kureli\u0107 (Croatia)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00e1nos M. Bak\nExternal Reader: Szabolcs de Vajay (Vevey)\nThe Counts of Cilli were princes of the Holy Roman Empire without a princi-\npality of their own. Scholars have pointed out the uniqueness of this phenom-\nenon in the fifteenth century. Moreover, many activities of this powerful family\nthat spanned two realms\u2014the empire and the Kingdom of Hungary\u2014still\nremain shrouded in mystery. Their seemingly endless financial resources and\nwide area of influence contrasted with a relatively small personal domain.\nI approach the problem from a social perspective, dealing with the\nproblem of status and social standing, its presentation and recognition. By\nanalyzing charters, correspondence, and narratives, I try to establish how their\nrank was perceived by the society in both realms, the empire with its rigid\nLehenspyramide, and Hungary with a nominally egalitarian nobility. I also examine\ntheir seals and try to decipher their symbolic message to see whether they can\ntell us something about their owners\u2019 identity and ambitions.\nFrom the birth of Ladislaus V, in whose stead Ulrich II Cilli held the\ncrown and read the coronation charter, until his Shakespearean assassination in\nBelgrade, I trace the path of the counts of Cilli in their struggle for recognition\nand prestige.\n286Abstracts\nElizabeth, Queen of Hungary (1320\u20131380), and the \u00d3buda Clares:\nA Study in Reginal Burial Site Selection\nBrian McEntee (United States of America)\nThesis Supervisor: Marianne S\u00e1ghy\nExternal Reader: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Szende (Hungarian National Museum)\nElizabeth, Queen of Hungary, was buried in 1380 in the \u00d3buda Clares\u2019 convent,\na nunnery of her own foundation. The convent has been studied previously\nusing historical sources and more recently through archaeological inquiry,\nalthough the question of why Elizabeth decided that this location should serve\nas her burial place has never been asked. This thesis argues that burial site\nselection, rather than being mandated by tradition or custom, was a deeply\npersonal choice made by Elizabeth. She chose the Clares\u2019 convent both because\nof her particular affinity for the \u00d3buda foundation, in whose establishment and\ngrowth she was especially involved, and because of her spiritual commitment to\nthe Poor Clares, the religious order to whom the majority of her religious\npatronage was directed. Likewise, this work posits that there is an important\nconnection between widow queens and the building of monastic foundations\nthat eventually serve as their sepulchres and that there is a difference between\nkingly and queenly burial site selection.\nContinuity at the Medieval Church at Zalav\u00e1r-R\u00e9c\u00e9sk\u00fat\nMaxim Mordovin (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisors: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky, B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs\nExternal Reader: Istv\u00e1n Feld (E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest)\nThis work deals with the results of the excavation of a medieval site in Zalav\u00e1r-\nR\u00e9c\u00e9sk\u00fat. This place was inhabited from the ninth century until the Turkish\nwars. Due to insufficient publications, a long-lasting scholarly debate started\nabout the periodisation of the building and its identification, but none of the\ninterpretations can be accepted until a new thorough evaluation is done. In this\nthesis I focus on the chronology of different phases and the question of\ncontinuity at this site.\nThe first two chapters give an outline of the historical events in this region\nand show the complexity of the research connected to Zalav\u00e1r. The next chapter\nsummarizes the research history of this particular site starting from the very\nbeginning and including the most recent opinions. After describing the documen-\n287Abstracts\ntation, especially recently discovered documentation made in the first years of the\nexcavation and unknown before, I emphasize the differences in the quality of these\nrecords and problems of their interpretation. Investigating the documentation I\nestablished a relative chronology for this site, described the building history of the\nchurch and the following building. To clarify the chronology of the two main\nphases of the ecclesiastical structure I evaluated the burial data of the cemetery\naround the church. The last two chapters deal with the question of continuity at\nZalav\u00e1r-R\u00e9c\u00e9sk\u00fat and a possible absolute chronology based on pottery analysis.\nAs a result I have delineated three main phases of the settlement during\nthe Middle Ages: a ninth-century church, a second church built in the \u00c1rp\u00e1dian\nperiod (eleventh to thirteenth century) that reused the earlier building, and a\nlate-medieval (probably fifteenth-century) fortified manor house. I could not\ngive a more precise absolute chronology by evaluating the pottery data. By\ndemonstrating the continuity of the ecclesiastical role of the building, I also\nsupport the idea of the continuity of the population at this site from the ninth\nuntil the eleventh century.\nThe World Through the Eyes of the Tolkovaya Paleya:\nThe Story of Original Sin in the Hilandar Manuscript\nAlen Novalija (Slovenia)\nThesis Supervisor: Johannes Niehoff-Panagiotidis\nExternal Reader: Vladimir Petrukhin (Institut of Slavic Studies, Russian Academy of\nSciences, Moscow)\nA Paleya is a type of historical and exegetical writing compiled by Byzantine and\nOrthodox Slavic authors, in some redactions taking on a strong anti-Judaic\npolemic character. This thesis deals with the Paleya in general, and with the\nHilandar manuscript of the Tolkovaya Paleya of 1633 in particular (the only non-\nRussian copy of the Tolkovaya Paleya), which has been completely neglected so\nfar by scholarship.\nScholars of the nineteenth century identified different types of Paleyas,\nespecially trying to establish the time the Tolkovaya Paleya emerged and its geo-\ngraphical provenance. Consensus on the last issue, however, still has not been\nreached, as some opt for an early Bulgarian origin, while others support the\nhypothesis that it was compiled in thirteenth-century Russia.\nIn the first chapter I present the characteristics of all types of the Paleya,\nand offer an overview of the scholarly research on the Paleya to date with some\ncritical remarks. I put the Paleya into a broader context of Byzantine and Old\nRussian literature and try to establish the reasons for its emergence, its\n288Abstracts\nfunctions, audience, and diffusion. As regards its functions, I have tried to\ndemonstrate that the Paleya was a substitute for the Old Testament and its\nchronological overview and also helpful in the liturgical field. It was an en-\ncyclopaedic companion which offered a comprehensive worldview and guide-\nlines for further reflection, rather than a handbook for the fight against the Jews\nand Judaism. At the end of the chapter I give a detailed description of the\nHilandar manuscript and discuss the copyist and reasons for his work.\nThe second chapter is the edited text of the story of the Fall with my\nEnglish translation, which gives the reader an opportunity to come into direct\ncontact with the text and, for one who knows Church Slavonic, to see the\nseventeenth-century South Church Slavonic standard and its interaction with the\nEast Slavic prototype.\nIn the third chapter, a commentary on the edited text, I explore its relation\nto the corresponding texts of the Bible, genre aspects in the text, and its sources.\nMoreover, I connect the Paleya\u2019s handling of the story of original sin to the\npatristic tradition and compare it to the related accounts in other Paleyas, with\nspecial attention to their apocryphal sources.\nThe conclusion of the third chapter is that the author was well acquainted\nwith teachings of the Church Fathers, as his assertions and foci are to be found in\nthe works of the most distinguished Church authorities. What is more, he used\napocryphal material with much greater caution than compilers of other Paleyas.\nFinally, as regards the attitude towards the Jews, it can be said that the author takes\na very harsh stance against Judaism. His addresses to the Jews range from compas-\nsionate pity to fierce offence, but in this thesis I try to show that this is a literary,\ninstructive, and exegetic device rather than a true attack on any specific Jews.\nMadness in Yvain Reconsidered\u2014A Comparative Study of\nYvain by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes and its Medieval Translations\nCatalina Soloveanu (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Gertrud Blaschitz (Institut f\u00fcr Realienkunde, Krems)\nYvain ou le chevalier au Lion by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes has been translated into Middle\nHigh German, Old Norse, and Middle English. During the translation process\nthe scene of madness, which stands at the center of the Old French romance,\nhas been adapted and transformed. Scholars have noticed that this scene in the\nOld French original represents the hero\u2019s separation from civilization; his\nsojourn in the forest is read as a rejection of the values of society. This thesis\n289Abstracts\nargues that although there are many levels of difference between the translations\nand the original text, the basic opposition of madness vs. civilization is still\nperceived and understood by the translator of each text. The points of\ndivergence concern the social values that push the hero to madness and the\ndetailed descriptions of clothes and food.\nOckham\u2019s Theory of Demonstration\nSimona Vucu (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: George Ger\u00e9by (CEU), Paul Bakker (University of Nijmengen)\nExternal Reader: Istv\u00e1n Bodn\u00e1r (CEU, Budapest)\nIn this thesis, William Ockham\u2019s conception of demonstration is examined,\npaying attention to the way Ockham is changing the theory of demonstration in\norder to adjust it to his own ontological or theological views. In dealing with\nOckham\u2019s theory of demonstration I looked at his relation to other medieval\nthinkers: Robert Grosseteste, Thomas Aquinas, Walter Burley, and John\nBuridan. The main source for this research is his last philosophical work, Summa\nLogicae III-2, however, some problems related to the theory of demonstration\nare also addressed in the Prologue to his Commentary on the Sentences of Petrus\nLombardus or Ordinatio. Both texts are discussed to some extent in the modern\nliterature, nevertheless, there are sufficient shortcomings so that a new examin-\nation of Ockham\u2019s theory of demonstration is needed.\nThe thesis is organized according to what I thought were the most\nimportant problems of Summa Logicae III-2. The first chapter deals with the\nprior knowledge that is required for having valid demonstrations. Here Ockham\nlays down the requirements for terms and propositions that can enter into\ndemonstrations. In the second chapter, I discuss the kinds of demonstration.\nThe last chapter is dedicated to the problem of the demonstrability of the\nanswers to the four Aristotelian questions (si est, quid est, quia est, propter quid est).\nThe conclusion of this thesis is that, on the one hand, Ockham is enlarging\nthe domain of demonstrative knowledge, both in the sense of a more\nepistemologically orientated approach to the theory of demonstration and in the\nsense of widening the domain of possible things about which one can construct\ndemonstrations. On the other hand, from his treatment of different topics of\nthe Aristotelian theory of demonstration, his own semantic, ontological, and\ntheological conceptions emerge, showing that Ockham was always ready to\nchange the traditional perspective when that was needed, so that the theory of\ndemonstration also took on an Ockhamist flavor.\n290",

One way to add meaning to his assertions was,\nas in many other cases, the use of Classical allusions. Comparisons with\nAlexander the Great or other ancient heroes were common for Kydones.34 The\nmost instances when Kydones used a large number of topics connected directly\nwith his understanding of the emperor\u2019s role can be found in the group of\nletters sent during Manuel\u2019s stay in Thessalonica between 1382 and 1387. This\nsegment of Kydones\u2019 correspondence deserves special attention since it is\nactually the most extended in the whole collection of eighty letters to Manuel,\ncomprising thirty-one pieces.35 These letters seem to record a certain amount of\nindirect information36 concerning the evolution of the ongoing military activities\nin which Manuel was involved; this situation was also reflected in the use of\ntopics such as that of the emperor as a model for others (par\u00c0deigma).\n33 In the same category can be included the official form of address found in L 282.4:\npr\u00cdV t\u00can s\u00can $efal\u00c2n (\u201ctowards your [noble] person\u201d).\n34 See L 397.27 or L 82.65.\n35 L 80, L 203, L 243, L 244, L 247, L 249, L 250, L 253, L 258, L 259, L 262, L 271,\nL 276, L 277, L 282, L 283, L 284, L 294, L 299, L 302, L 304, L 306, L 308, L 309,\nL 315, L 318, L 312, L 320, L 326, L 327, L 342.\n36 R.-J.

This concerns the\nintellectual side of Manuel\u2019s activity, reflected in the use of the concept of\n\u201cphilosopher-king.\u201d The notion is plainly expressed in two instances; in L\n259.23: \u2026t\u00cdn fil\u00c5sofon basil\u00c1a, \u2021\u00dd m\u00c5non Pl\u00c0twn l\u00c1gei pa\u00c6sein $a$\u00ben\n(\u201cthe philosopher king, about whom Plato says that he is the only one capable\nto put an end to the evils\u201d), and L 239.14, immediately after Manuel\u2019s return\nfrom Thessalonica: $a\u00cc n\u00bdn \u00dam\u00bbn saut\u00cdn, \u2021\u00ddn h\u00e6xato Pl\u00c0twn \u00e1deixaV, t\u00cdn\nfil\u00c5sofon basil\u00c1a (\u201cand now you showed yourself in our eyes as the one\nwhom Plato wanted, the philosopher king\u201d).\nKydones\u2019 correspondence challenges this concept through another one,\nthat of the rhetor-king, a reflection of the intellectual environment in which\nboth correspondents were active. \u0399n L 309 he clearly replaces the virtues of the\nphilosopher with those of the orator in an attempt to persuade the king\nconcerning a political decision.47\nOne finds displayed here an important principle that Kydones tried to\nfollow in his political endeavors, that of combining the Byzantine need of\npolitical salvation with the need of the politician to have a more active scholarly\nlife. This emerges most clearly in the letters which he sent to the young Manuel\n46 L 193.53: ta\u00bdta soi, basile\u00bd, \u00d0neisf\u00c1rw mi$r\u00c8 m\u00c9n \u00dep\u00c1r m\u00c9g\u00c4stwn (\u201cI report to\nyou, emperor, these unimportant events instead of the significant ones\u201d) and L 315.4\u20135:\nmi$r\u00c8 per\u00cc mi$r\u00ben t\u00ben \u2122em\u00ben l\u00c5gwn o\u00d4\u00c5menoV (\u201cI have small thoughts about my own\nsmall affairs\u201d).\n47 \u201cRegarding the exhortation to stay and not to move there is a piece of advice\nappropriate both for an emperor and a rhetor; for a rhetor could take from here many\ngood reasons, telling the citizens that they must preserve the faith in their country, and\nan emperor, who has the duty to save the cities, what other kind of reasons more\nappropriate to him could he choose than those by which he persuades the citizens to\nstay in town and confront the dangers and prefer to take the risks together with him\ninstead of fighting abroad. Taking such advice you proved a skillful orator, and, as an\nemperor, you showed great care for the cities.\u201d\n34abstract content included\nin the epistolary text, however, a friendly relationship can surely be\nreconstructed. Referring only to this intellectual aspect and indicating the\ncommon interests which linked the correspondents in a relationship which\nsurpassed the official sphere, one needs to consider the common cultural idiom\nin circulation identifiable by the ubiquitous Classical quotations.\nThe most valuable information for assessing this relationship comes from\nthe analysis of the changes in tone and attitude perceptible in the collection;\nthus, a more intimate tie is usually expressed by means of subjective statements.\nIn many cases the messages Kydones sends to the emperor contain direct\nreferences to his personal situation. This is expressed especially when he speaks\nabout his personal journeys. Thus, L 382 contains a long introduction where the\nprevailing information concerns the writer himself, who starts in first person\nnarrative style: \u2122eg\u00cf cq\u00c9V \u00d0nacwr\u00ben \u00d0p\u00cd so\u00bd... (\u201cafter I left you yesterday...\u201d)\nand continues in the same style. Subjectivity becomes more visible in the last\nletters, written after 1390, where the epistolographer devotes much more space\nto private facts than to questions of public activity.\nAnother concern which emerges from this group of letters regards\nKydones\u2019 health problems. Such subject matter was not a novelty in Byzantine\nepistolography, as it recurs in early Byzantine epistolography. At some points,\nlike for example in the eleventh century, sickness was rather a constructed\nepistolary theme than a real fact, representing a common element in an epistle\n48 Loenertz, \u201cD\u00e9m\u00e9trius Cydon\u00e8s, 119.\n35abstract controversy about the knight and the cleric, but the real-life dialogue\nbetween a woman and a man. Nemus becomes a poetic, but ordinary, part of\ndaily life and as such has its negative side. The sylvan space is not sacred\nanymore; it is a human, not a divine location. The forest is connected with\nemotions, but on a more realistic human level.\nThis poem presents a rather different image of the forest. The sylvan space\nis ideal, but this time for seduction and this fact makes it ambiguous. Both the\nact of seduction and the forest are perceived from two different perspectives.\nThe girl says that I was such a wonderful little girl, while I was a virgin (Ich was ein Chint\nso wolgetan, virgo dum florebam)46 and repeats cursed be the linden tree by the road\n(maledicantur tili\u0119 iuxta viam posit\u0119) in the refrain. At the same time the man sings\nThere stands a beautiful linden tree (Iz stat ein linde wolgetan).47 Nemus is still a locus\namoenus, a magical and idyllic world, yet it is also a hidden, obscure, dramatic\nplace. According to the girl, nemus is not a secure and joyful playground. In this\nsense, this poem is unique, as it depicts the only relatively negative image of\n44 Er sprach, \u201cvrowe, gewir baz,\nnemus est remotum\u201d.\nDirre wech der habe haz,\nPlanxi et hoc totum.

This phenomenon appeared at the end of the thirteenth\ncentury as a concomitant of the representation of realistic space and it has been\nvariously considered as a bearer of symbolic content or a decorative detail of the\nbackground. The thesis argues that the \u201cimage-within-picture\u201d can be both,\ntherefore generally and universally it is impossible to define whether it is a\nsymbol or not. As a response to this indecision, a method is developed to\nanalyze whether the embedded \u201cimage\u201d in each case is a fanciful ornament or a\ndetail with definite symbolic implications. This method is applied in the thesis to\nthe Legend of St. Francis in the Upper Church at Assisi, which is the first\nknown example of this phenomenon. The analysis of the \u201cimages-within-\npictures\u201d of the cycle shows that when the painting of the frescos began in\nAssisi these details were decorative motifs of the background, and then at a later\ntime (frescoes 21, 22, and 23), they took on symbolic content, presumably as a\nresult of an impulse from the hagiographic tradition of St. Francis and from the\nFranciscan order. The thesis concludes that the direction of the historical\ndevelopment shows that the symbolic emerged out of the decorative. This\nmodel is an example for the investigation of other \u201cimages-within-pictures\u201d in\nthe painting of the fourteenth century.\n269Abstracts\nPhysical Violence and the Church: The De Declaratoriis Petitions from\nthe German-Speaking Area during the Pontificate of Paul II\nDan Sebastian Cri\u015fan (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: Gerhard Jaritz, Katalin Szende\nExternal Reader: Torstein J\u00f8rgensen (Center for Medieval Studies, University of Bergen)\nThis work deals with physical violence in the petitions addressed to the\nApostolic Office of the Penitentiary during the pontificate of Paul II (1467\u2013\n1471). In these petitions clergymen and laymen alike asked for absolution and\ndispensation which could be granted only by the pope himself, due to the se-\nriousness of the faults and crimes involved. An important part of this source has\nbeen published by Ludwig Schmugge for the German-speaking territories in the\ncollection Repertorium Poenitentiariae Germanicum. Only a few scholars have\nexplored and analyzed the material so far, however.\nThe research on the De declaratoriis supplications, one of the two categories\nof petitions which contain mostly cases about violence, revealed important\npatterns in how acts of violence occurred. These patterns concern time and\nspace, social status, the weapons used, and injuries inflicted. They show to what\nextent the practice of physical violence in the supplications can be linked with\nthe norms of canon law and secular law and to what extent violence was\nregarded and handled as part of the everyday life of clerics and laymen.\nAdornment, Devotion and Prestige.\nSixteenth-century Stalls in Transylvanian Churches\nZsuzsanna Eke (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: Gerhard Jaritz, B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs\nExternal Reader: Charles Tracy (Independent scholar, Ipswich)\nThis thesis focuses on stalls from Transylvanian churches as objects with several\nlayers of function and meaning. The stalls were not merely objects of high value,\nbut were also, along with other furnishings, objects used to represent the wealth\nof the congregation.\nTransylvanian stalls have thus far been of little concern in the scholarly\nliterature of Romania. Both material and textual sources are scarce, and it is\ndifficult to trace their evolution and significance through history. This thesis is\nan endeavour to amend this situation, looking at stalls not just from the point of\n270Abstracts\nview of art history, but also involving patterns of behaviour concerning the\ndisplay of prosperity and social prestige.\nThe thesis focuses on three churches in medieval settlements of different\neconomic and social statuses: the free royal town of Sighi\u015foara (Segesv\u00e1r), the\nmarket town of Biertan (Berethalom) and the village of B\u0103gaciu (Bog\u00e1cs). In the\ninterpretation of the material I took into consideration the location, quality, and\nquantity of stalls, which are often decorated with intarsia, Flachschnitzerei carving,\nand/or paint. The fact that the settlements all owned stalls of high quality may\nbe confusing at first glance, but when seen in the context of secularization in the\nusage of stalls and a power struggle between thriving communities, it confers\nnew meaning on the perception of the problem.\nIn conclusion, the stalls had several layers of function starting from\naesthetic purposes to showing status. They were used to adorn the interior of\nthe church, and to make it more comfortable. Donating them played as\nimportant a role in social life as sitting in them. They were integrated into\nliturgical usage and also into secular display and representation. After the\nprocess of secularization, when lay people could also use them, they became a\nplace where one could show wealth and status as well as devotion.\nMedieval Challenges Modern:\nThe Posthumous Fate of Christianus monachus and His Legend\nElena Glushko (Russian Federation)\nThesis Supervisor: G\u00e1bor Klaniczay\nExternal Reader: Du\u0161an T\u0159e\u0161tik (History Ustav, Prague)\nThe authenticity of the so-called Christian\u2019s legend, which contains the Lives of\nSt. Wenceslas and St. Ludmila in broad historical context and claims to have\nbeen written at the end of the tenth century, was one of the most debated issues\nin Czech historiography from the late eighteenth century onwards. For a long\ntime scholars felt the need for writing a history of this debate; however, not\nmuch more than a standard overview of previous literature, written from a\ncertain standpoint, has been given until now. This thesis deals with one aspect\nof this debate, namely, the image of Christianus monachus in the works of a\nnumber of scholars who were especially active in this discussion from the\neighteenth to the twentieth century. I distinguish three elements which\nconstitute this image: 1) the author of the legend 2) the historical figure, the son\nof a nobleman from the circle of St. Adalbert of Prague, and 3) the image of\nStrachkvas as given in the Chronicle of Cosmas of Prague. This allows an analysis\n271Abstracts\nof how the images of medieval Bohemian history, created by different scholars,\nwere influenced by their reading of Christian\u2019s legend, and how this reading\ninfluenced their dating of the legend. Mainly aesthetic preferences determined\nthe dating of the legend and the choice of proofs. The analysis of the legend was\nmade more difficult by the existence of two other images connected with its\nauthor; scholars solved this problem in different manners. In the last few\ndecades all three sides of Christianus monachus have been united and the\nauthenticity of Christian\u2019s legend is recognized.\nThe Landscape of Power:\nThe Spatial and Territorial Dimensions of Urban Leadership in\nFifteenth- and Sixteenth-century Sopron (ca.1480\u20131580)\nK\u00e1roly Goda (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: Katalin Szende\nExternal Reader: Peter Johanek (Institut f\u00fcr Vergleichende St\u00e4dtegeschichte, M\u00fcnster)\nThe main aim of this thesis is the study of the power relations and topographical\npresence of the civic leaders (judges and mayors) in sixteenth-century Sopron,\nan important border town in Western Hungary. According to former scho-\nlarship, the governing burghers were historically determined by their economic\nbackground and exercised power for two or three decades without any family\ncontinuity. This analysis detailed evidence on different levels in order to reach\nbeyond generalizations created earlier.\nUsing the theories and tools of network analysis and spatial reconstruction,\nthe thesis presents a double approach resulting in an archontological and\ntopographical reconstruction. Key findings include the observation that a con-\ncentration of power took place in the period examined and the circles of leaders\nwere drawn from consecutive generations. It is also argued that the political elite\nwere closely held together by social and spatial bonds. Nevertheless, the\ninvestigation highlights that the leading circle was neither a closed group of\npatrician families nor an ever-changing constellation of relationships. The\nformation of the groups reflected both familial and meritocratic recruitment.\nIn the second part of the thesis, the question of whether the above-\ndescribed pattern also had an impact on the territorial dimensions of urban\nleadership is discussed. In the rivalry for material resources four shifts could be\nobserved in the structures of possession in downtown Sopron. Moreover, other\neconomic holdings in the suburbs as well as in the neighboring wine-producing\nareas played a crucial role in developing and maintaining a personal power base.\n272Abstracts\nConsequently, the different lands around Sopron, on the one hand, functioned\nas links to former leaders, and on the other hand, they reflected strong\nrelationships among contemporaries. Finally, they indicated continuity with the\nsucceeding generations. As a result of the multidimensional approach applied in\nthe thesis, the patterns of political cooperation and spatial continuity proved to\nbe as strong as economic competition and social change in power structures of\nthe town.\nStudy on Parallel Translations of Passages from the Seventh Chapter of\nOn the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite into\nOld Church Slavonic and Church Slavonic\nTsvetelina Hristova (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisors: Gy\u00f6rgy Ger\u00e9by, Johannes Niehoff-Panagiotidis\nExternal Reader: Heinz Miklas (Universit\u00e4t Wien)\nThe thesis explores the presence of translated passages from the works of\nPseudo-Dionysius in the Slavic world and analyses three examples found in the\nSymeonic Florilegium of 1073 as a case study of the rendition of excerpts from the\nCorpus Dionysiacum. The passages used are from the copy of 1073 and the thir-\nteenth-century Hilandar copy of the Izbornik. They are juxtaposed to the corres-\nponding passages in the full translation of Corpus Dionysiacum accomplished in\n1371 by the Athonite monk Isaja and a short quotation found in a fifteenth-\ncentury hesychast miscellany, No. 641, from the library of the Hilandar\nmonastery. The translation technique and translation decisions in the passages\nare analysed in three parts: syntax, word formation, theological and philo-\nsophical terminology. The conclusions that result from the analysis concern the\ndifferences in translation praxis and some changes in word formation patterns\nthat resulted from the development of Slavonic as well as changes in the Slavic\nequivalents of Greek philosophical terms.\n273Abstracts\nNymphaion: A Byzantine Palace in Exile\nJulia Jedamski (Germany)\nThesis Supervisors: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky, Johannes Niehoff-Panagiotidis\nExternal Reader: Michael Angold (University of Edinburgh)\nThe main focus of this thesis is the Late Byzantine palace at Nymphaion in\nwestern Asia Minor, probably built under the reign of John III Vatatzes (1222 to\n1254). The palace was the imperial residence during the aftermath of the\noccupation of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204, when the Byzantine\nelite was driven away from the capital.\nByzantine art historians analyzed the style and elaboration of the inner\ndesign of the building in several articles between the 1950s and 1970s. The\ninvestigation of this thesis adopted the method of Residenzenforschung, dealing not\nonly with the archeological remains of the building, but also with contemporary\nwritten testimonies (authored by Akropolites and Pachymeres) and their reports\nabout Nymphaion as such. Thus, the aim was on one hand to show the concept\nof the palace, and on the other, to place the site Nymphaion into the territorial\norganization of the Laskarid realm. By combining these sources it becomes clear\nthat a decentralized system of several locations, connected through regular\nimperial travel, itinera, was set up to cope with the loss of Constantinople.\nNymphaion can be seen as one important imperial residence among others in a\ndecentralized Byzantine territory, following the Western model of Reisek\u00f6nigtum.\nDiet and Social Stratification in \u00c1rp\u00e1d-Period Hungary:\nA Paleostomatological Analysis\nKatherine Kondor (Canada)\nThesis Supervisors: Alice Choyke, J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky. External supervisors:\nIldik\u00f3 Papp, Zsolt Bernert (both: Natural History Museum, Budapest)\nExternal Reader: Zsuzsanna Guba (Natural History Museum, Budapest)\nThis study analyzes two \u00c1rp\u00e1d-period populations from the area of Visegr\u00e1d-\nV\u00e1rkert in Hungary. These came from the cemeteries of the archdeacon\u2019s\nchurch, interpreted as a more elite social group, and the nearby village/parish\nchurch, interpreted as a less elite social group. Physical anthropological analyses\nhad been already carried out on the cemetery populations and many archaeo-\nlogical studies have been done in the area. This study combines these completed\nexaminations with history and paleostomatological analyses in a study of 109\n274Abstracts\nskulls. The teeth of the two cemetery populations were examined on the basis of\npre-mortem tooth loss, dental caries, dental wear, cysts/abscesses, and enamel\nhypoplasia. The data were then used to draw conclusions about the diet and\nhealth, hence social and economic surroundings, of the two populations.\nA historical introduction is followed by a short history of paleo-\nstomatology, a general overview of the pathologies examined in this study, and a\ndiscussion of taphonomy and its implications for physical anthropological\nresearch. The results of the earlier physical anthropological analyses of these two\ncemetery populations are summarized and the methods used here are presented.\nThe last chapter describes what was found for the two cemeteries, and sub-\nsequently compares the two results.\nThe conclusions can be divided into two parts: diet and health. What was\nfound through the analysis of dental wear and dental caries is that the diet of\nthese two populations did not differ a great deal; the dental wear in these two\npopulations was nearly the same. This suggests that both populations used\nsimilar quality flour for their bread, probably coming from the same mill. The\nanalysis of dental caries showed that the distribution of protein and carbo-\nhydrates in the diets of the two communities did not differ extensively, and it\ncan be concluded that both communities consumed almost equal amounts of\nanimal protein. Not much difference was found in the frequency of cysts and\nabscesses between the two populations, so nothing can be concluded about\ntheir general health based on these factors. Enamel hypoplasia showed that the\ngeneral health of those in the village community was worse during childhood\nthan for children of the elite community.\nChanging Roles in Demetrius Kydones\u2019 Correspondence to\nManuel II Palaiologos\nFlorin Leonte (Romania)\nThesis Supervisor: Johannes Niehoff-Panagiotidis\nExternal Reader: Margaret Mullett (Queen\u2019s University, Belfast)\nAmong its four hundred and fifty letters, Demetrius Kydones\u2019 correspondence\ncontains a large number of epistles addressed to Manuel II Palaiologos, one of\nthe last emperors of Byzantium, written over a span of approximately thirty\nyears during the second half of the fourteenth century. Up to now scholars have\nconsidered this epistolary corpus almost exclusively as a reservoir of historical\ndata. The thesis argues that these letters can also be viewed as documents\nattesting the reality of a complex relationship between Kydones and Manuel in\n275Abstracts\nthe framework of a larger social network detectable in late-fourteenth-century\nByzantium. This relationship is based on a series of different roles Kydones\nconstructs in his epistolary collection: a teacher speaking to his disciple, a\nsubject addressing an emperor, and a friend communicating with another friend.\nMethodologically, I approached the text from two directions: first, I high-\nlighted the main landmarks in the social and intellectual landscape where\nKydones took an active part; second, I identified the main options he had for\nrhetorical expression which he used in composing his texts. These concerns\nrepresent the two pillars of the subsequent analysis of the elements he included\nin the process of constructing his social roles.\nThe study is aimed to constitute a section of a more comprehensive\ninvestigation of the social connections which united the political and intellectual\nmembers of the Byzantine elite in the late fourteenth century. In spite of the\ndifficulties concerning the nature and the completeness of sources, by taking\ninto account elements of epistolary discourse such as the official titles, adjectives\nconnected to them or other added meanings, one can get a clearer picture of\nhow people interacted and acted in those times.\nKitchens in Medieval Hungary\nKrisztina Orosz (Hungary)\nThesis Supervisor: J\u00f3zsef Laszlovszky\nExternal Reader: John Steane (independent scholar)\nThis thesis focuses on the kitchens of medieval castles and monasteries in\nHungary, dealing not only with the architectural layout and parts of the kitchens,\nbut the kitchen staff and kitchen utensils as well. A catalogue is attached at the\nend of the thesis which contains almost all of the approximately 30 medieval\nmonastic and castle kitchens which have been published or for which pictorial\nevidence remains. The main goal of this thesis is to answer the following\nquestions: How many and what kinds of kitchens were in medieval Hungarian\ncastles and monasteries and what did they look like? Where were the kitchens\nlocated in a given building and for whom and by whom was food prepared in\nthem?\nExamination of monastic kitchens revealed that Hungarian monasteries\ncontained only one kitchen, which catered for the monks. Only the Dominican\nnunnery on Margaret Island had more kitchens. This does not mean that most\nmonasteries had just one kitchen in medieval times, only after the examination\nof further examples can this question be decided. I am convinced that in larger\n276Abstracts\nmonasteries which have not survived or have not been excavated yet there must\nalso have been more than one kitchen catering for the abbot, the guests or the\nsick, but examples of these have not survived. The monks\u2019 kitchens were mostly\nsituated in the wing which was opposite the church, beside or near the\nrefectories, and were square or oblong in plan. Polygonal, detached kitchens, as\nin Western Europe, were not built in Hungarian monasteries.\nAs to castles, only in the cases of the castles in Visegr\u00e1d and Esztergom\ncan it be demonstrated, and assumed in the case of Buda Castle, that there was\nmore than one kitchen in the building complex (a privy kitchen and a great\nkitchen), which would show high social status. In most Hungarian castles only\none kitchen or in several cases none, are known, but because of the large-scale\ndestruction of medieval castles it cannot be precluded that there were more. In\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the great kitchens were mostly situated\nnear the dining halls, while from the early sixteenth century onwards one can\nobserve a tendency to place them in separate domestic buildings which might\nalso contain bakeries and storerooms. Privy kitchens were mostly situated near\nthe apartments of the owners of the castles or palaces and their family since this\nkind of kitchen catered for them. While the kitchen tower was usual abroad, in\nmedieval Hungary only in the case of L\u00e1nzs\u00e9r Castle (Landsee, Austria) can it be\nassumed that such a tower existed.\nA general feature of Hungarian castle kitchens may be the great pyramidal\nchimney. The collected information on kitchens reveals that they usually\ncontained only one fireplace. These fireplaces resembled Central European\nexamples and differed from English and French fireplaces, which had other\nforms. According to the scant evidence, table-like hearths were used in Hungary\nonly from the first half of the sixteenth century. Built-in stone basins used to\npour out wastewater were also characteristics of Hungarian castle kitchens.\nUnlike Western European castle kitchens, Hungarian kitchens did not contain a\nwell in the Middle Ages. Mostly wells and cisterns provided water for the\nkitchens; they were situated in the castle courtyards, usually near the kitchens or,\nin the case of monasteries, in the cloister garths or in the domestic courts. In\nmonasteries, monk cooks worked in the kitchens doing weekly service. The\nkitchen staff of the late medieval royal court was complex, managed eco-\nnomically by the clerk of the kitchen, with the cooking directed by the chief\ncook.\n277Abstracts\nThe Finances of Bra\u015fov at the Beginning of the Sixteenth Century\nZsolt Simon (Romania)\nThesis Supervisors: Bal\u00e1zs Nagy, Katalin Szende\nExternal Readers: Andrea P\u00fchringer (University of Marburg), Istv\u00e1n Drask\u00f3czy\n(E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest)\nThe aim of this thesis is to analyze the finances of Bra\u015fov (now Romania; in\nLatin: Corona, in German: Kronstadt, in Hungarian: Brass\u00f3), one of the largest\ntowns of medieval Hungary. The sources of the investigation were all the\nremaining medieval town accounts, covering the period between 1506 and 1526.\nAfter a short introduction to the sources, secondary literature, and histo-\nriography, I present the town\u2019s financial administration. The finances of Bra\u015fov\nwere strongly interlocked with the finances of the district of B\u00e2rsa, of which the\ntown was the centre. That i,s taxes, juridical expenses, the costs of envoys and\nguests were administered commonly by the town and the district. These\nexpenses were controlled by the financial officer of the district, called the villicus.\nThe town\u2019s finances were in the charge of the two stewards (procuratores) who\nwere elected by the council and were responsible to the council.\nThe town\u2019s yearly income usually varied between approximately 3000 and\n4000 florins; the average value was 3600 florins, the extremes 1000 florins and\n6000 florins. On average, 92% of the income came from taxes, 4% from an\nindirect wine tax, and 1% each from an indirect beer tax and mills; finally, less\nthan 1% of the tax income resulted from estates, sales, and fines. These data\nshow that Bra\u015fov\u2019s finances were mainly based on one source of revenue, the\ndirect tax, and that urban estates and enterprises were not important for the\ntown\u2019s income.\nThe town\u2019s yearly expenditure usually varied between 3000 and 5200\nflorins; the average value was 4100 florins, the extremes 2000 florins and 6000\nflorins. Most of the expenses, almost 70%, were dedicated to paying taxes. The\nnext largest items were the military and construction costs, the latter being\nmainly costs of fortification.\nComparison with two other Hungarian towns, Cluj (Kolozsv\u00e1r, Klausen-\nburg) and Bratislava (Pozsony, Pressburg), showed that the finance structures of\nthe three towns were similar. In some German towns, in contrast, the direct tax\ndid not play as important a role among either the incomes or expenses, but the\nshare of indirect taxes was larger.\n278Abstracts\nDevotion, Donation, and Memoria.\nUrban Society and the Dominicans in Late Medieval Reval (Tallinn)\nGustavs Strenga (Latvia)\nThesis Supervisor: Gerhard Jaritz\nExternal Reader: Felicitas Schmieder (FernUniversit\u00e4t Hagen)\nTestaments and other devotional sources of the Late Middle Ages from Reval\nshow the role the Reval (Tallinn) Dominicans played in local urban society.\nUntil now, scholars have researched only the structural history of the Domi-\nnican friary in Reval, and no one has looked at the spiritual influence which the\nDominicans had in the society of the Late Middle Ages (1400\u20131524). This paper\nargues that the Dominicans had important influence not only on the religious\nlives of individuals, but also on the structural groups of Reval. This paper also\nshows the preferences of individuals who donated money and objects to the\nDominican friary in Reval and what kind of religious services they requested\nfrom the friars in return.\nImaginary Space in the Carmina Burana:\nUrban Scholars and the Forest in the Twelfth-Century Renaissance\nSvetlana Tsonkova (Bulgaria)\nThesis Supervisor: Marianne S\u00e1ghy\nExternal Readers: \u00c1gnes Dukkon (E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University, Budapest), Herman Braet\n(University of Antwerp)\nThe Carmina Burana is the largest and most significant collection of medieval\nLatin poetry in Europe. Created at the end of the twelfth and beginning of the\nthirteenth century, it contains a large number of poems on satirical, love, and\ngambling themes. Most of the authors are anonymous; still, there are data about\ntheir rich intellectual urban background. Thus, their poetry can be examined in\nthe context of the twelfth-century Renaissance and its major intellectual\ntendencies.\nThe research here is focused on the love songs of the Carmina Burana and\nmore specifically on the forest space in these texts. Although many scholars\nhave examined the book and its contents, the sylvan element of the love songs\nremains almost untouched so far. The goals of this thesis are to collect and\npresent in one paper all the love poems, which contain an image of the forest, to\ntrace the characteristics of the forest as an imaginary space, and to put this\n279Abstracts\nimage against the philosophical and rhetorical background of the twelfth-\ncentury Renaissance.\nAfter presenting the research question and the methodology, an overview\nis given of the twelfth-century Renaissance, the Carmina Burana, and its authors.\nFurther chapters present the image of the forest in twelfth-century philosophy,\nrhetorics, and poetry. The final chapter analyses the forest as an imaginary space\nwith three aspects: silva, nemus and Walt.\nThe conclusion is that the forest in the love songs of the Carmina Burana is\nnot simply a poetic ornament. It is a complex image, developed in several\ndirections. The sylvan space in an imaginary idyllic locus amoenus had a number of\ncommon features with the pagan sacred grove, but also with the image of the\nprimordial womb, as it was presented in neoplatonic twelfth-century philosophy.\nAt the same time, the forest appears to have been one of the fantasies of\ntwelfth-century intellectuals, who lived in an urban environment but dreamt of\nbirth-giving nature and magical woods.\nBathsheba in Late Medieval French Manuscript Illumination:\nInnocent Object of Desire or Agent of Sin?\nM\u00f3nica Ann Walker Vadillo (Spain)\nThesis Supervisors: Gerhard Jaritz, B\u00e9la Zsolt Szak\u00e1cs\nExternal Reader: Eva Frojmovic (University of Leeds)\nThis research focuses on Bathsheba and her visual representations in French\nmanuscript illuminations from the Late Medieval period. During this time,\nimages of David watching Bathsheba bathing were very popular as the number\nof surviving manuscripts attests. Yet, for all its popularity, this subject has been\nneglected by contemporary scholarship in general. In the few studies undertaken\non Bathsheba she is usually presented as a negative figure, as a seductress from\nthe Old Testament, but is she? The two main questions that this study addresses\nare: Why were the images of David watching Bathsheba so popular during the\nLate Middle Ages? How was the image of Bathsheba understood by a medieval\naudience?\nThe first chapter analyzes the scholarship written on Bathsheba; it\ndescribes the primary evidence, and the problems presented by reading images.\nThe second chapter focuses on King David and the visual representation of his\nstory emphasizing the position of Bathsheba within his complex narrative. The\nthird chapter focuses on the independent episode of David watching Bathsheba\nbathing clothed or in the nude. The fourth chapter focuses on the context of\n280Abstracts\nnudity, the gaze, and its visual representation. In this chapter other subjects\ndepicted in the nude are considered. The fifth chapter presents Bathsheba in a\ncultural context which shows her as a vehicle for multiple meanings and\npossibilities beyond that of seductress.\nThe conclusion is, first, that Bathsheba could be presented to the medieval\nviewer not only as a seductress, but also as an innocent object of desire; the pre-\nfiguration of the Church; a positive image to arouse sexual desire in a married\ncouple; a warning against Vanity, or she could be all of these depending on the\nmedieval viewer or reader. Second, due to the multi-layered \u201creading\u201d exper-\nience that Bathsheba could be subjected to, the popularity of her iconography\ncannot be ascribed solely to the naturalistic rendition of her body in a highly\nerotic and seductive situation. Hence the representation of the body of\nBathsheba becomes a vehicle for social meaning which moves beyond mere\nsensuality and eroticism towards a deeper and more complex array of\npossibilities for the medieval viewer, which might have been the key to its\npopularity.\n281",

The less\nthis natural development of man is influenced by ecclesiastical or\npolitical guardianship, the more efficient and harmonious will\nhuman personality become, the more will it become the measure of\nthe intellectual culture of the society in which it has grown.1\nAccording to Rudolf Rocker, anarchism is apossibility. It is a route\nto a richer, more interesting and freer future, an opportunity for spiritu-\nal and political development: an unclosed ideal, an open choice, an\nuntried and attractive possibility. The anarchist steps into the future and\ncreates a new future without rule.\nThe role of the social scientist who examines anarchism is much\nmore prosaic. First, he or she can seek to outline the theoretical system\nand the various types of anarchism\u2014the approaches of the political\nphilosopher and the political scientist.\nSecond, he or she can study when, in what form, how and why\nanarchism emerges in particular historical situations, which social stra-\nta present anarchist demands, and how the anarchist movement is orga-\n1abstract law\u2014that is, outside the phenomenal world\n\u2014anarchism sees the source of harmony in individuals themselves.32\nThe alternative strain of anarchism, by contrast, makes reference\nto the basic precepts of Christ\u2019s teaching, to primitive Christianity and\nto fundamental concepts of other beliefs, and it sets as its goal the\nrenewal of religion. It contends, for example, that Christ\u2019s teachings are\nbest represented not by church norms and institutions that have hard-\nened into malformed conventions but by the ideas of anarchist social\norganization. Its representatives thus have an anticlerical orientation\nbased upon religion. Georg Simmel analyses the motivations behind\nthese movements of religious renewal in the following terms:abstract level, the movement would ultimately like everyoneto accept\nthe principles of anarchy. If just one person does not accept them, it is\nnot possible to use the instruments of the state, the law or violence\nagainst them, for this would contradict anarchism\u2019s antistatist and anti-\nrulership principles. The emphasis is on the word \u201ceveryone\u201d\u2014the\nanarchism of alland thus the condition of anarchy. In anarchist society,\nantianarchist deviance cannot be effectively sanctioned. But if every-\none were an anarchist there would be no need for anarchism. The utopi-\nan character of anarchism can be clearly apprehended at this point, for\na precondition for its realization coincides with its goal. Anarchy can-abstract, stylized concepts that are condensed from the rejection\nof social reality and from timeless oppositional values.\nStemming in essence from this is anarchism\u2019s inability to act\u2014a\ncharge raised against anarchism in particular by Marxists. Indeed, anar-\nchism does not believe it possible to attain large-scale social goals by\nindirect means. Following Hegel, it accepts that \u201cthe aim is none other\nthan the result of the means used to achieve it,\u201d which in the present\ncase means that a social goal cannot be attained through the instruments\nof political power. This theoretical consistency has more than once ren-\ndered anarchists incapable of action, and has ensnared them in the trap\nof \u201cpolitical activity without politics.\u201d As a result of this paradox, they\nhave either restricted themselves to pure theory, in which case they\nhave lost the opportunity to form events, or they have been forced to\nenter politics, in which case they have had to bend their principles\nsomewhat. Such a compromise was made by Bakunin, when his group\nattempted to change the First International from within,81 by Schmitt,\nwhen he joined the peasant agrarian-socialist movement as an ideolo-\ngist,82by Alexander Berkmanand Emma Goldman, when they briefly\ntried to cooperate with the Bolsheviks,83 and by the anarcho-syndical-\nists, who, at the cost of giving up certain of their principles, aligned\nwith the class-based goals of the workers.\nThe dilemma between action according to goal-based rationality,\nemphasizing usefulness, and that according to value-based rationality,\nemphasizing ideals, is thus resolved for those anarchists who remain\nloyal to their principles by the idealization of human properties. This\ncauses the abstraction of anarchist theory and its practical inoperabili-\nty. We may be assisted in understanding this connection by Rosa\nMayreder\u2019s theory of the periods of development of social movements.\nThis differentiates three sequential periods in the development of criti-\ncal social movements: (1) the \u201cpurely intellectual stage\u201d; (2) the \u201corga-\nnizational stage\u201d; and (3) the \u201cpower stage.\u201d In the first period theoret-\nical coherence, in the third the demands of power dictate the activities\nof the movement.84\nAnarchism has often remained theoretically and morally \u201cpure\u201d\nbecause it has not left\u2014and not been able to leave\u2014the purely intellectualabstract antistatism and their belief in the possibil-\nity of abolishing the state prevented them from perceiving a functional\nrole for the state\u2014for example, in investigating crime, in education or\nin social policy. Often they did not recognize the concealed methods\nused by groups with an interest in maintaining the state and the politi-\ncal system to uphold those interests, or the organic adaptation of those\ngroups to the system of economic and social reproduction. In short,\nthey did not recognize the deep socioeconomic embeddedness of the\nstate; they saw the state as independent of society, and thus believed not\nonly that it was possible to oust it, but also that it was an organizationabstract, ideological level. At the\nmovement level, contemporary representatives of anarchism are gener-\nally united in opposing the excessive power of the state and in support-\ning the protection of the environment and of alternative life forms such\nas those of sexual and racial minorities.\nTo sum up the differences between collectivist-communist and\nindividualist-libertarian anarchism, we may state that while the collec-\ntivist tradition emphasizes social solidarity, absence of property, mutu-\nal aid, direct participation and redistribution according to need (the ele-\nments of positive freedom), the individualist tradition stresses individ-\nual sovereignty and freedom, private property, free trade and the com-\nplete absence of all forms of coercion (the institutions of negative free-\ndom).134The two strands are united by opposition to rule, the demand\nfor change, and the desire for a free, stateless society.\n4.2. Anarchism versus Other Ideologies\nThe differentiation of these two branches of anarchism is eased if\nwe can locate anarchism among other major ideologies. Anarchism has\nnever existed as an actual social system, and we must therefore recog-\nnize that our model below displays the ideal types of anarchism and lib-\neral socialism (or their realtypes based only on certain limtied societal\ncommunities) together with the real types of actual systems.abstract law. According to the new moral worldview, Batthy\u00e1ny\nexplained, social harmony cannot arise through regulation by higher\nauthorities, but \u201conly from the nature of the people themselves, from\nthe people\u2019s unboundedly free manifestations of life, from their ever\nchanging adaptations to their needs.\u201d\nBatthy\u00e1ny\u2019s goal was the development of the individual, for he saw\nthe genuine nature of man as being concealed in solidarity\u2014which is\nlimited by power systems based on violence and by theocratic preju-\ndices. As his starting point dictated\u2014for it referred to the natural uni-\nversality of the individual\u2014anarchism became not a historical, but a\nuniversal phenomenon, and ruling forms were transitional. He catego-\nrized the many currents within social theory into two main, mutually\nopposing orientations. One strand strove, according to Batthy\u00e1ny, for\nthe maintenance of the consolidated system of society, and included lib-\neralism, conservatism and Christian socialism. Opposed to these stood\nsocialism and anarchism, which advocated the construction of society\non wholly new foundations.abstractions of solidarity and univer-\nsal love of humankind. \u201cThe stateless society, voluntary collaboration\nand personal success are unrealizable in the form and by the means con-\ntemplated by the anarchists, for change without violence or transition is\nincompatible with the basic conditions of communism and internation-\nalism, freedom and development, and because they offer no animating\nor organizing guiding principles.\u201d162 In Cz\u00f3bel\u2019s view, these extreme\nmeans would result in precisely the opposite of the prescribed goals,\nthough the goals are valid and could gradually be realized on the basis\nof patriotism, the promotion of a public spirit and mutual goodwill.\nDevelopment leads everywhere indispensably to class differences, and\ncomplete social levelling creates a static society that cannot develop\nand may even fall apart.abstract,\nimpersonal system of rules. The exposure of this, the uncovering of the\n\u201csecret\u201d is the task of anarchism, for once this has been done the legit-\nimacy of the state cannot be maintained.\nIn place of state privilege, the good society must be built upon a\ncompensatory system of equality, behind which lies consensus con-\nstantly renewed through social debate and acceptance of comparative\nselfishness. \u201cEveryone must choose the privilege that is appealing to\nthem and the disadvantage that is not so disagreeable.\u201d33The members\nof the society accept the axiom that \u201cit cannot be good for everyone that\nit is not good for everyone,\u201d34 but within this stipulation the indepen-\ndent communities of society are in constant conflict\u2014both within\nthemselves and with each other.\nThus, on this conception, the possibility of the good society is cre-\nated not by some original natural property, nor by a substantive good,\nbut by a compensatory system of equalities. This guarantees autonomy,\nor \u201cthe ability of all of the people themselves to determine laws for\nthemselves.\u201d35The equality of autonomies gives the possibility of free-\ndom and of a society that\u2014without substantive definition of the\ngood\u2014is good for everyone. This eliminates pure selfishness, but it\nretains \u201ccomparative selfishness,\u201d for it is good for me, and it is possi-\nble that what is good for memay at the same time be good for others.\nThough the book\u2019s critics pointed out perceptively certain logical\ncontradictions in its argument, (a) that the deduction from the prefer-\nences of the individual to the distribution of social situations good for\neveryone is lacking; and (b) that the substantive definition of the moral\nis unavoidable even when the absolute subjectivity of the good is pos-\ntulated,36 Tam\u00e1s\u2019s contribution nevertheless occupies an important\nplace in the history of Hungarian anarchist thought. Despite its rela-\ntively weak impact on the political thinking of the nascent opposition it\nwas a significant attempt, after decades of state socialism, to conceptu-\nalize an ideal society based within the socialist tradition understood\nbroadly. It is likely that the difficulties in doing this contributed to the\nfact that, following the publication of the book, Tam\u00e1s distanced him-\nself from the anarchist conceptual universe and, several years later,\nwhile retaining a strictly antistatist orientation and seeking to minimizeabstract:\nin regard to the general mentality and moral orientation of political\naction. Second, the two orientations share the final goal of a society\nwithout rule. Just as the anarchists, J\u00e1szistated that \u201ca free corporation\nof free individuals\u201d can be created.134 Third, they share a common\ninternal construction: \u201cliberal socialism is anarchistic in more than its\nultimate tendencies: the air of individual freedom applies to the intel-\nlectual structure of the entire school.\u201d135\nThe difference is that, in order to attain the final goal, liberal social-\nism recommends concrete political action in place of anarchism\u2019s\nabstract social theory and direct antistatism. In J\u00e1szi\u2019s view, the correct\npath involves (in addition to liberal socialism\u2019s cooperative-based\nsocialist economic program) the establishment of self-governing circles\nbuilt upon broad rights of freedom guaranteed by the state, and, in place\nof the elimination of power, its division and equalization.\nThe dilemma between state despotism and revolutions by a minor-\nity can be solved only if we progress towards the common ideal\nstate that is embraced by both liberal socialism and liberal anar-\nchism, i.e. towards the greatest possible decentralization, the great-\nest possible autonomy, the mostextensive spontaneous association,\nexcept where the monopolistic character of the preliminary natur-\nal-technical conditions of the factories force the state to take these\nover.\u2026Liberal socialism does not merely flirt with democracy, but\nrather takes it to its limits: it seeks to achieve self-determination\nand self-government for every viable group.\u201d136\nThis symbolizes the three basic principles already mentioned:\ndecentraliation, self-government, and association.\nJ\u00e1szi\u2019s thoughts on these matters did not subsequently change sub-\nstantially, but they were pushed into the background. J\u00e1szihimself did\nnot publish his book, and it appeared only in the 1980s\u2014first in Paris,abstract system indepen-\ndent of the social and political environment. If, however, meaning is\nuncertain, formed again and again in the process of discourse, the\nEnlightenment philosophers\u2019conception of the single, general, unques-\ntionable \u201ctruth\u201d is strongly questioned. Thus, the recognition that we\nhave no means of direct access to \u201creality\u201d leads to uncertainty. Fur-\nthermore, it is not clear on what criterion we may decide among differ-\nent statements formed about \u201ctruth.\u201d\nThe theorists of postmodernism\u2014Lacan, Derrida, Lyotard, Deleuze,\nFoucault\u2014complete the linguistic turn in twentieth-century philosophy\nand historiography. The starting point for their radical interpretation is\nthat there is no meaning or consciousness without language. For them,\nthe fact that meaning is socially and linguistically constructed excludes\nall certainty and renders any statement about general moral or scientific\n\u201ctruths\u201d impossible. There is no guarantee of the identity of meaning; no\none can be in possession of general truth. Postmodernism thus launches\na frontal attack upon the concept of objective truth. It contends that every\nstatement about truth is tied to values, and thus that every system of ideas,\nwithout exception, is ideological: every one hides within itself the seeds\nof power. Following Foucault, postmodernism states that power and\nknowledge are thus inseparably intertwined in public discourse and in\nevery sphere of human language use and thought, and it rebels against\nideologies that conceal this. Postmodernism\u2019s goal is, according to J\u00f3zsef\nB\u00f6r\u00f6cz, \u201cto expose the complete presence of knowledge/power in these\nconstructions, and thus to cast light on their deep insincerity. Through the\nimplosion of the dividing lines between basic elements of earlier theoret-\nical constructions, postmodernism seeks to end the distinction between\n\u2018high\u2019and \u2018low\u2019cultures and to abolish all the binary oppositions of tra-\nditional philosophy.\u201d174\nA similar approach to this has been used by Noam Chomsky in\nanalyzing the language of mass communication and by Paul Feyer-\nabendin the theory of science. Both authors consciously refer to anar-\nchism\u2019s intellectual legacy and openly express sympathy towards polit-\nical anarchism.175 The link between postmodernism and the anarchist\nmentality is, however, generally rather less direct.\nTo summarize, the linguistic revolution wrought by postmod-\nernism expresses the anarchist mentality in that it proclaims a form ofabstract statelessness in the domestic political realm. By contrast, the\ndemocratic conception of international federalism has become highly\nsalient with the highly debated future federalist organization of the Euro-\npean Union.195 The reason for this is that the principle of democratic fed-\neralism is well suited to the nature of the modern capitalist economy. By\nthe end of the twentieth century, capitalism had outgrown the confines of\nthe nation-state and become a global phenomenon\u2014a process that was\ncompleted with the collapse of the communist world system. It became\nglobal not only in the sense that countries and companies traded with one\nanother across the whole world, but also in that the international compa-\nnies themselves penetrated beneath the skin of the nation-states in every\npart of the world. To the global investments of multinational corporations\nare connectedglobal money, commodity markets and information sys-\ntems. All of this leaves the traditional concept of national sovereignty\never more obsolete. Into this process fits the unification of Europe, which\nhas revived the concept of democratic federalism with the unambiguous\nprimacy of business interests.196By contrast, in eastern Europe the need\nto transcend ethnic nationalism and the interests of minority protection\nspeak in favor of the creation of a democratic regional federation.\nWhile on the international stage anarchist federalism has largely\nproved ineffective, at the subnational, local level, it has not lackedabstract prerequisites for the\nemergence of new social movements, while their social base consists pri-\nmarily of the middle class, white-collar employees and intellectuals.\nDeep changes to social structure lay behind the emergence and, in\nhistorical terms, rapid breakthrough of the alternative movements in the\nlatter part of the twentieth century. The development of a middle class\nencompassing a large part of society and, more generally, the increas-\ning number of educated employees are consequences of the post-indus-\ntrial turn in Western societies. The essence of the shift to the post-\nindustrial society that began in the 1960s is, according to Daniel Bell,\n\u201ca changeover from a goods-producing society to an information or\nknowledge society.\u201d203 In practical terms, this transformation brings a\nshift from manufacturing to services, the use of new technologies and\nthe expansion of a new technical elite. The social reality that best char-\nacterizes post-industrial society is that of manmade symbols\u2014in con-\ntrast to the natural world and the material world characteristic of indus-\ntrial society. \u201cThe post-industrial society is essentially a game between\npersons.\u201d204The leading sectors of the post-industrial economy are the\nknowledge-based sectors, the computer industry, robotics, scientific\nresearch and development, and business information services. At the\nsocietal level, this is combined with leisure and recreation pusuits, an\nincrease in the time and value that people devote to themselves, the\nrapid development of the visual world (mass culture and advertising),\nincreased respect for sensual experiences, and the development of sec-abstract antistatism could possess.\nAs Bookchin writes,\nCapitalism has developed technology to a point where the super-\nfluity of human needs in the western world and the capacity to satis-\nfy them has given well-to-do people the opportunity, indeed, the his-\ntoric luxury, of bringing many of their needs and technics into ques-abstract antistatism, but rather a healthy scepticism vis- -vis the\nnew, democratic state power, and a moral balance against corruption.\nAs the liberal historian Lord Acton reminded us, \u201call power corrupts,\u201d\nfor the representatives elected to power by the people become profes-\nsionalized and bureaucratized; that is, as the anarcho-syndicalist Robert\nMichels argued, in all power organizations, the \u201ciron law of oligarchy\u201d\nis unavoidable. In writing his anarcho-syndicalist critique of the over-\ncentralized German Social Democratic Party with its concentration\nupon the parliamentary faction, Michels formed what remains one of\nthe fundamental theses of political sociology.215 This thesis remains\nvalid even if the demand for stability in central Europe today empha-\nsizes the benefits of elite politics. The civil society concept of \u201csociety\nagainst the state\u201d216 appears today in the new social movements built\nfrom below in opposition to the oligarchies, in the organization of citi-\nzens\u2019initiatives, in civil disobedience and in the principle and practice\nof rotation. These efforts will have no effect if they remain strictly anti-\nstatist and do not perform the role of counterbalancing elite politics.\nHow can we sum up the message of this for the current historical epoch?\nFrom the viewpoint of postmodern philosophy, the enemies of\nanarchistic revolt are rigid, hierarchical systems of thinking and the ide-\nological world of value-laden bipolar oppositions that conceal interests.\nFrom the feminist viewpoint, they are social hierarchies based on\nauthority, dominated by men, and centerd on patriarchal thinking. For\nthe green movement, they are the idolization of the economy, the irre-\nsponsible use of dangerous technologies, the quest for absoluteness in\nnarrow-minded science, political rule and state violence. For federalism\nthey are centralized, restrictive political organizations. The common\ndenominator underpinning the critiques presented by all of these move-",

The recent hardening of penalties in some\ncountries, or related changes in sentencing was also linked to actions of politicians and public\nopinion. Some reports noted that especially higher level penitentiary experts discussed such\nstructural limits to the reintegrating function of prisons and pressures for the security imperative.\nMany believed that prisons should do more for reintegration, however, were often to some\nextent disillusioned or pessimistic and pointed to the lack of financial resources and personnel\nas a key barrier to such work. Agents\u2019 discourse showed strong similarities across the countries;\nperhaps it was the agents in England and Germany who were more explicit about airing their\ncritical opinion about the sufficiency of reintegration efforts in women\u2019s prisons and detailed\nknowledge about women\u2019s needs and imprisonment.\nHowever, National Reports often went beyond agents\u2019 discourse and presented the unfavourable\nratios between personnel employed and budgets spent on security vs. reintegration in prison.\nWith these arguments, national reports demonstrated that while national legislations in all cases,\nand even agents\u2019 discourse, quite frequently remain very supportive of the principles of\nreintegration, in actual reality, the security imperative controls most of the budgets and personnel\nin prisons.

The paper offers an overview of some recent estimates of social\ncapital in Hungary comparing the country with other EU countries and others in Central and East Europe.\nNext, it addresses regional development and social capital, including core topics such as territorial distribution\nof social capital, its association with various aspects of regional development. The section also includes related\nresearch on social capital in cross-border relations, minority governance, and social capital and local labour\nmarkets. TThe final part deals with specific policies targeting uneven regional development, in particular, the\ncurrent and upcoming EU co-financed regional development policies. Here, the question of regional influence\nin shaping absorption capacities will be highlighted, in particular, relations between the local public, private\nand civil sectors and relations between the regional and central authorities. The paper concludes with an\noverview of the few Hungarian analyses of Europeanisation, with special emphasis on the role social capital\nplays in influencing the operation of Structural Funds, in particular, the impact of greater civic engagement\nin the production of National Development Plans\n1 This report was drawn up for \u201cThe Challenge of Socio-economic Cohesion in the Enlarged European Union\u201d (SOCCOH,\nProject no.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThis report analyzes the changing institutional framework for regional policy making in Hungary. Using\nprimary and secondary materials, it examines efforts to prepare a new inter-mediate tier of government\nfor planning and executing socio-economic policy. Although there were significant internal forces shaping\nthis process, regionalization has been strongly influenced by the cohesion programs of the European Union.\nThese programs stressed the importance of building up the capacity of NUTS II regions for establishing\ndevelopment priorities and operating through principles of partnership between private, social, and public\nsector actors. This report examines domestic settings for regional policy, providing detailed information\nabout South Transdanubia, and then the implementation of the major pre-accession funds, the first\nNational Development Plan, and the first sectoral and regional operational programs. This is followed\nby a critical examination of the changes brought in by the second National Development Plan 2007-\n2013. The report confirms that EU funds had an extraordinary impact on institutional building and\ntransformation in Hungary. However, the channelling of post-accession funds has been hindered by the\nweakness of regional institutions, leading to reluctance by both the central state and the EU to confer\nprogramme autonomy on the regions.\n1 Center for Policy Studies, Central European University and the Center for Regional Studies, Hungarian Academy of Sciences\nrespectively.

(RDC chairman, August 2006)\nThe member quoted earlier blamed the lack of any real regional identity for the absence of region-\nconscious decision-making. He also criticized planners from another angle. He claimed that instead\nof developing a genuine, regionally tailored development strategy, the South Transdanubian planners\nbrought about nothing but \u201ca national plan at a regional scale\u201d. Some dissatisfaction was reflected in\nthe opinion of those in charge of implementing the planning/programming. Being part of the complex\nnegotiating exercise with many actors, the top managers of the RDA clearly saw the narrow path of\nautonomous maneuvers.\n\u201cThe ROP is not the development program of the region. It is rather a collection of\nmenus offered for selected fields\u201d (Executive manager, RDA, August 2006).\n\u201cAt the end, the ROP came into birth within the frame of sectoral negotiations, so in\nfact, it is a sectoral program implementing \u2026 what the rest of the OPs could not be\u201d\n(Development Director, RDA, May, 2007).\nNevertheless, the same respondent judged the position of regional planning \u201cincomparably better\u201d\nthan ever before. He regarded bottlenecks as natural consequences of the uneven progress regionalism\nhad achieved in the country: \u201c\u2026 the wagon cannot go faster than the horse\u201d\u2014he said\u2014\u201cit will be\ndifferent once we will have elected regions.\u201d\nPeople did not complain about the limited autonomy of the planning procedure. With some\nexceptions, they generally agreed with the control from central government and the European Commission\non programming and implementation. The chairman of the RDC being in office since December 2006\nraised the issue of shared control between the government and the regions over programming and\nimplementation. Others pointed to the determining force of the procedures themselves:\n34",

        "abstract": "abstract theorizing and to look critically at what sociological\nsurveys actually tell us. We need to ask, in particular, to what extent the dynamics and manifestations\nof xenophobia in various East European countries have been similar or different. If they have, can we\npinpoint the reasons and agency behind the differences? Does the absence of racist violence, for\nexample, mean less intolerance or just a different kind? If so, why? What is the relationship between\nviolence and intolerance? Such comparative questions, in turn, raise the question to what extent\nmethods used to measure xenophobia in different countries are comparable.\nMost of the surveys on ethnic intolerance in Eastern Europe target relations between indigenous\nmajority and minority ethnic groups, or even more generally, attitudes toward ethnic, sexual, and\nlifestyle minorities all lumped together (see Turai and T\u00f3th 2002). Some of these include questions of\na more general nature, and often, the distinction between specifically xenophobic versus generally\nintolerant attitudes is hard to make. For instance, a 1998 survey found that only 36% of Latvians\nwould accept non-Latvians as friends or family members (Bogushevich and Tsilevich 2002). Two-\nthirds of Slovenes and 61% of Slovaks would reject such a possibility; also, 61% of Slovenes described\nthemselves as at least \u201csomewhat racist\u201d in an early 2000s survey (\u0160kolkay 2002). In a national poll in\nRussia in 1996, 41% of respondents \u201chad a negative attitude\u201d to members of other nationalities, but\nin a separate poll in St. Petersburg, 58% of respondents were not opposed to a family member\nmarrying a person of a different nationality (Sikevich 1999:104, 107). Nonetheless, since these studies\nare usually phrased with a focus on one or several \u201cindigenous\u201d groups, their indicativeness of a\ngeneral level of xenophobia is questionable. An increasing number of studies, however, focus\nspecifically on attitudes to foreigners.\n24abstract and pertain to some future danger of mass\nimmigration.12 Indeed, 74% of residents polled by them (Vitkovskaia and Zaionchkovskaia\n1999:115) and two-thirds of those polled by Larina (1999:96) think that Russia faces a \u201cChinese\nthreat\u201d, and two-thirds of Palyutina\u2019s (1996:343) respondents thought there were too many Chinese\nin the city. Perhaps for this reason, while nearly 80% agree that Chinese should be allowed to trade in\n12 Gelbras, however, found that negative attitudes usually had personal motivations such as \u201cthey occupy housing,\u201d \u201cthey\ntransfer money abroad,\u201d \u201cthey live better than we do\u201d (Gelbras 2001:147).\n27abstract ideas, with attitudes to migrants from the Caucasus somewhere in-\nbetween.\nVery few studies have focused on the nature of specific conflict situations between migrants and\nthe local population. Dyatlova (1998) applied the Rosenzweig test to a group of fifty Siberian\nstudents. In this test, respondents are asked to imagine themselves in a situation of frustration caused\nby another person, which is depicted in a cartoon. When the \u201cfrustrator\u201d was given a Chinese name,\nthe number of aggressive reactions, the likelihood to blame the other party, as well as to attribute the\nsituation to ethnic traits of the \u201cfrustrant\u201d increased. Examples of reactions are: \u201cIf she weren\u2019t at least\nhalf an hour late, she wouldn\u2019t be Chinese!\u201d \u201cThere are liars in China, but not in Russia.\u201d \u201cI am\nsurprised that my girlfriend doesn\u2019t refuse to go to a dance with a Chinese.\u201d\nContrary to Hungary and Russia, studies in Poland suggest an increasing acceptance of\nimmigration: 41% of a representative sample in 1999 agreed that foreigners should be allowed to\nsettle in Poland, compared to 17% in 1996 and 29% in 1998 (Kaczmarczyk 2001:209).\n2.2 Comparative Data\nStudies aiming to measure xenophobia in a comparative fashion in various Eastern European\ncountries include the International Social Survey Program (ISSP, 1995), which covered 22 countries;\n28",

        "abstract": "abstraction fairly freely, at the level of their application disregard for institutions -\nand other conditions theorists conventionally assume away - can be a source of\ndifficulties. It is hardly surprising if the lack of the rule of law, the often\ninsurmountable obstacles to contract enforcement and the frequently blurred state\nof proprietary rights together breed what US theorists call private enforcement\ntechniques, and those in the region refer to as Mafia capitalism. Weak state power,\npoor quality and often changing regulation (that may surface in thousands of\ndecrees trying to address peculiarities that judiciary interpretation of what a stable\nand transparent law should) and very high profits from rent-seeking practices\ntogether created an ideal environment for these. It is worth noting, that not only in\nSoutheast Europe and in the CIS can one observe these features, but also in the\nBaltics, where good macrostatistics sometimes overshadow the twin burden of\nSoviet legacy and spill over of crisis phenomena from the entire post-Soviet region\nto these traditional \"commercial gates\" (Ostrowska 1997). It seems certainly naive\nto believe that this type of Mafia capitalism would spontaneously transform itself\ninto a more civilised edition of the market order purely because Mafia bosses wish\nto secure their property rights. In fact, from Southern Italy to Korea, not to\nmention some stagnant \"developing\" nations, one could observe the stabilisation of\nrent-seeking rather than competitive structures for historically long periods of\ntime. This can be explained in terms of standard economic theory. First, if one type\nof equilibria emerges, short of external shocks, there is no reason for us to expect a\nchange. Second, if in the years of formation of norms and rules rent-seeking\nbehaviour pays off and the related informal institutions also crystallise, this will be\ninternalised by the successful players and society at large as a role model. The\nprobability of these structures to solidify rather than to be civilised is certainly\nhigh. This issue is far deeper in scope than the problem of corruption and of street\nviolence would indicate. It creates a long term economic and security problem\nboth for these states and their partners short of remedial actions. In theoretical\nterms it also means that the minimalist approach to the state (Aslund 1995; Naishul\n1993) proved to be self-defeating as the outcome is - understandably - a long way\nfrom any version of a liberal market order. Thus in assessing market maturity of\nentry candidates both to NATO and EU it seems ill-advised to adopt a narrow\ntechnicist focus, as e.g. the 1995 White Book of the Commission did.\nAdvancement in some areas, especially if it is formal, can certainly not make up\nfor some qualitative characteristics that may well have gone under due to the much\ntoo technical focus of raising questions. The questionnaire of the Union also\nsuffered from such a narrow approach.\n2. It were equally naive to postulate that globalisation per se would tackle the issue.\nOn the contrary, external investors in general, but especially portfolio investors\nadjust to the prevailing regulatory frame. Although examples of attempts at lever-\naging state administrations abound, it is fairly clear that the latter have a major re-\nsponsibility for shaping the regulatory as well as the macroeconomic environment\nfor the individual investor. Merely changing the ownership title, even if it implies a\ntransfer to foreign private property is but one step on the long road towards theabstracted away by neo-classical growth models will",

Thus it\nseems legitimate to skip what initially used to be the topic of a large body of\nliterature, i. e. whether it is in the interest of either side to enlarge, and if yes,\nwhy and when.

This is also taken\nhere as given, although - as I tried to argue elsewhere (Csaba 1997) - it is\npractically far more relevant a precondition for enlargement than any other\nsingle issue. The angle of analysis remains narrow and one-sided, with an\nexclusive focus on the readiness of the frontrunner transforming countries for\neventual Union membership. A third, no less important topic to be assumed\naway is that of not(yet) members, as well as problems related to Russia,\nUkraine and all of the post-Yugoslav states except Slovenia. The latter is a\npractical matter, and provided the theoretical structure of the analysis below is\nsound enough, the findings may be generalized so as to contribute to setting the\nconditions for possible future decisions on enlargement, as well as clarifying its\nlimitations. Fourth , I also mostly disregard otherwise weighty issues of public\nchoice for Central Europe, i. e. whether current EU arrangements are necessary\nand sufficient conditions for laying the groundwork for their sustainable\ndevelopment. Low growth coupled with high unemployment in the 'target\nzone' may legitimate such theorizing. But for the present purpose the Europe\nAgreements as binding international contracts, are accepted in which would-be\nmembers already in 1991-92 compelled themselves to take over the (present\nand future) acquis communautaire rather than criticize it.2 If these are seen as\nirrational or triggering intolerable costs in case of enlargement, this is just\nanother urge for internal reforms rather than to deny the feasibility of\nenlargement, on the dubious methodological ground of a status-quo extra-\npolation. For the present paper it is assumed, that a solution to this challenge\ncan be, and indeed will be, found either via more spending or - more likely -\nby trimming previous entitlements when the new financing guidelines for the\npost-2000 accession period will have been set. The ways and means of\nattaining this goal also fall outside the scope of the present exercise, which is\nthe fifth relevant explicit assumption/limitation of our reflections here.\n1 Bringing a bunch of flowers may or may not represent a gesture of deeper sympathy,\ndepending on the situation.

First, such initiatives as the adoption of the EU Charter of Human Rights or\nthe further streamlining the EU Treaty may have their merits on their own, but were unlikely to deliver those\nflexibilities that have been hoped for at the launching of the new IGC.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper argues that although the multination state is closer to meeting the standards of\nethnocultural justice than the one-nation state, the alternatives to nation-building cannot be\nneglected. It analyses the claim that if ethnocultural justice requires that the one-nation state give way\nto the multination state, then ethnocultural justice also requires that exclusive jurisdiction give way to\noverlapping jurisdictions. It also shows, using the example of recent developments in Hungarian\nnationalism, that the change in the international environment has impacted the perception of political\nalternatives.\nKeywords: nation-building, nation-states, ethnocultural justice, Hungary, nationalism\nSubject: Comparative Politics, Political Theory, Public Policy\nCollection: Oxford Scholarship Online\n1. Introduction\nIn his article on ethnic relations and Western (liberal) political theory, Will Kymlicka proposes to take the\nnation\u2010building state as given and to focus on variations in the ways ethnocultural diversity is handled in\nthe course of the process of nation\u2010building. \u2018[T]he issue is not, he says, whether states engage in nation\u2010\nbuilding but rather what kind of nation\u2010building.\u2019 I disagree.\nTo be sure, the political organization of any modern society requires a population that is literate, is capable\nof communicating with public o\u0000cials, shares a sense of common identity, and recognizes the institutions\nclaiming authority over it as its own. Call the population endowed with these characteristics a political\ncommunity. In so far as the characteristics of a political community are not naturally given but need to be\ncreated before, in the course of, or after the emergence of the political organization, any attempt at\nestablishing authoritative political institutions is preceded, accompanied, or followed by a process of\ntransforming the subject population into a political community. Nation\u2010building is such a process. But it is\nonly a special case in building political communities, one which corresponds to the rise of the political\n1\norganization usually called the nation\u2010state.\nDownloaded\nfrom\nhttps://academic.oup.com/book/9348/chapter/156138161\nby\nCEU\nLibrary\nuser\non\n19\nJune\n2023abstract reasoning made above must\nsu\u0000ce.\n3. The Hungarian Case\nEven if defensible in principle, is the idea of overcoming the nation\u2010state regime relevant for the\ncontemporary world? Can it contribute to the process of devising viable strategies for handling\nethnocultural diversity\u2014here and now? The collapse of the Soviet world system left the successor states\nwith an enormous amount of ethnic and national con\u0000icts\u2014can the thesis of this rejoinder be of any help in\nattacking them?\nThis question requires a drastic change in the level of discussion. The second section has presented an\nabstract normative argument. In this Section, we must turn to empirical description. I will try to show,\np. 233 using the example of recent developments in Hungarian nationalism, that the change in the\ninternational environment has already had an impact on the perception of political alternatives.\nLet me begin by stating the \u2018national question\u2019 as Hungarians see it. The contemporary history of the\n\u2018Hungarian case\u2019 started when World War I was concluded by the Versailles peace treaty. Hungary found\nitself cut o\u0000, as a result of that treaty, from two\u2010thirds of its historic territory and one\u2010third of the ethnic\nHungarian population. Dismemberment of the traditional state of Hungary came as a shock for the ruling\nclasses, and they reacted by adopting an uncritical stance of irredentism, supported by a myth of Hungarian\nsupremacy and special mission in the Carpathian basin. The central issue for Hungarian nationalists became\nhow to undo the terms of the peace.\nO\u0000cial irredentism set the target of restoring the Kingdom of St Steven as it stood until the war, with a\nreckless disregard for the ethno\u2010demographic realities in the areas detached from Hungary, and without\ngiving serious thought to the strategic isolation of the country. Under the tutelage of France, the inheritor\nstates were united into a so\u2010called Petite Entente to contain Hungarian revisionist claims. In order to break\nout of the country's isolation, its rulers tried, \u0000rst, to seek alliance with Great Britain, a power supposed to\nbe interested in containing the in\u0000uence of France in Eastern Europe. When this attempt failed, they turned\nto fascist Italy for support. Finally, in the second half of the 1930s, they ended up as satellites to Nazi\nGermany. In Hitler, they found a leader ready and able to return to Hungary large segments of its detached\nterritories. Paradoxically, the two consecutive \u2018Vienna decisions\u2019 did what President Wilson promised to do:\nthey brought state jurisdictions very close to the distribution of ethnic populations.\nDownloaded\nfrom\nhttps://academic.oup.com/book/9348/chapter/156138161\nby\nCEU\nLibrary\nuser\non\n19\nJune\n2023",

Still, while fifty-fifty is far from being a rare outcome\nin the experimental tests of the game, it is in no way an overwhelming pattern. Again, the\naverage offer tends to be 60.\nSo the pattern of evidence we need to explain is really this: responders tend to \"punish\"\nradically unequal proposals by the seemingly irrational mutually disadvantageous veto, but\naccept offers that assign a slightly higher share to player I. At least two, somewhat different,\ninterpretations are possible. There might exist a shared social norm, which, instead of\npinpointing a unique ratio of \"fair\" distribution identifies a range of \"morally permissible\"\nallocations (say between 50:50 and 70:30). If this is the case, the problem of player I mainly\nconsists in finding out whether her estimation on the lower bound corresponds to that held by\nthe recipient (player II). On the other hand, it may be argued that the asymmetric structural\ncharacteristics of the game (the \"structural\" advantage assigned to player I) in itself generates a\nparticular distributional norm which is no less precise but not identical to the equal share norm.\nIf this is the case, the problem for the allocator is to find out which particular division of the\ncake conforms to a norm to which both players are willing to subscribe. Note that due to the\nrestricted response opportunity of the recipient it is very difficult to disentangle these two\ndifferent understandings of the \"norm\".\nNow, positing a norm with vague boundaries poses the difficulty that it can explain just about\nany outcome. The second possibility opens up another question as well: which structural or\ninstitutional characteristics have an effect on the fairness norm? The potentially broad range of\nstructural or institutional variables, that the rules of the Ultimatum Game should\ncomprehensively track, cannot be clustered into a limited taxonomy in order to yield testable\npropositions. Neither is it easy to discern how these variables could yield norms for\ndistribution. We will return to this issue shortly.\nAs it is nearly always the case, one feature of the strategic situation stands out as a crucial\n2abstract\ngame may trigger well-established norms that are not particularly adaptable to the central\nproblem of the game. Consequently a new adaptation process starts, and through trial and error\nlearning a new equilibrium-generating norm replaces the old one. However, this view also\navails itself to an \u201cas if\u201d argument; in addition, it begs the question of what spans the fairness\nnorm itself.\nThere should still be a role for learning when the Ultimatum Game is played repeatedly. First,\nupon the previous arguments, there are good reasons to focus on scenarios when what went on\nin particular games does not become public knowledge, even if this implies that we abstract\nfrom an obvious way in which social learning about the fairness norm itself, and about the\nfairness of individuals, may be propagated. Next, consider that an equilibrium could arise\nwithout any of the players being directly motivated by the aim of implementing a particular\ndistributional norm. There is evidence that when the game is played repeatedly, many\nallocators who start out with the equal share offer move upwards in later rounds to demand\nslightly more for themselves. This suggests that there is need for coordinating on a pattern of\noffers, that is there is a need to reach by mutual adjustment a settlement between the players.\n2. The Competing Reasons Account\n4abstraction, all three were plausible a priori and the experimental results were hoped to prove or\nfalsify them, or at least to discriminate between their comparative strength.\nTotal transparency of payoff irrelevance. This hypothesis would claim that the structure of the\nperturbed game is still fully transparent to the players. They immediately understand that the\nantecedent random draw is irrelevant to the distribution problem. The prediction of this\nhypothesis is: no effect on relative offers (second session games continue with the same\nproposal ratios observable at the end of the first session games).\nGeneral perturbation effect. It also seemed possible that the perturbation of the baseline game\nsimply confuses the participants in their choice of strategy. The introduction of a payoff\nirrelevant action would induce divergent (and maybe individually inconsistent) behavior in the\nparticipants. In one sense the effect is similar to a sudden increase in noise level. Prediction:\noffer ratios in the second session would deviate from the mean offer ratio established in the first\nsession, but deviations would be non-patterned (random in the limiting case).\n\"Luck as strong entitlement\". This hypothesis is based on the argument that participants\nperceive the surplus generated by the antecedent random draw as a direct entitlement resulting\nfrom their physical action of rolling the dice. It is essentially a stylized and at the same time\nextreme formulation of the well-known Lockean theory of primary acquisition. This hypothesis\nwould predict that in second session games the proposer retains the entire surplus resulting\nfrom the draw and in absolute terms the proposed share to the responder remains constant\nacross the two sessions.\n\u201cCompeting reasons\u201d. According to this hypothesis, as the sum that can be distributed in the\nsecond session increases, the allocators will claim more for themselves than in the baseline\nscenario. But they do not attempt to claim all the surplus that is yielded by a lucky draw. As a\ngeneral observation we should note in advance that experimental tests suggest that the observed\nhigh offer ratios are insensitive to the magnitude of the payoff. The work of Cameron (1995),\nmentioned already above, reports the most convincing experiment in this respect. With this in\nmind we could exclude those accounts that use the magnitude-sensitivity argument. However,\nwe leave room for a size-effect that results from a lucky draw.\n\u201cEstablishing the norm\u201d. In our experiments, the same subjects were first confronted with the\nstandard Ultimatum Game and, in the second sessions, with the modified game as well.\n9",

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe paper analyses the organisation of mass political attitudes in Hungary. The analysis is based on\na survey of a national sample of adult Hungarians (N =1002), conducted in the autumn of 2000.\nPolitical attitudes and values items, representing various ideological orientations, were reduced to\na smaller number of latent ideological dimensions via factor analysis. The precise meaning of the\ndimensions is determined after the analysis of their relationships with authoritarianism, Social\nDominance Orientation, outgroup-sympathy, prejudices, ideological self-identification, party-\npreference and socio-demographic variables. Hungarian mass attitudes vary along conventionalism,\nsocialist conservatism, right wing conservatism and libertarianism. The latter three dimensions\npolarise politics into three oppositions: old versus new regime, religious-nationalist right versus\nsecular liberal-left, and libertarian versus authoritarian.\nKey words: structure of attitudes, ideology, political attitudes, Hungary.\nPublished as: Enyedi, Zs. & Todosijevi\u0107, B. (2003). Organization of Mass Political\nAttitudes in Hungary. Polish Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 34, No. 1, 15-26.abstract and more concrete attitudes relevant for\nspecifically Hungarian and post-communist ideological controversies. Although the scale aims at\ncapturing a wide set of ideological orientations, we placed a special emphasis on conservatism, and\ntherefore this ideology was more extensively represented. Its five components were: Protestant\nwork ethic, traditionalism, clericalism, primary conservatism, and nationalism. Next to items\ndirectly related to ideologies, we also added five items that represented attitude towards democracy\nand regime change. Items of the attitudinal scale are shown in Table 1 bellow.\nPolitical values were examined via a 22-item catch-phrase scale. The respondents\nexpressed their approval of politically relevant words or phrases on a 5-point Likert scale (higher\nscore indicating more positive evaluation). The method was originally introduced by Wilson and\nPatterson (1968), and is known since as the catch-phrase type of scale. The method has been\nfrequently used in studies of ideology (e.g., Truett, 1993, Searing, 1978). Middendorp and De\nVries (1981) showed that this type of scale provides comparable results to classic attitudinal items.\nItems of this type are also called 'criterial referents' (Kerlinger, 1984), though we were hesitant to\nlabel them criterial before examining the results of the analysis. These items are grouped into four\ncategories on the basis of the hypothetical ideological dimensions to which they belong. The first\n5abstract conservative and traditionalist\nitems. At the same time, it contained socialist items and a strong positive sentiment towards the old,\nsocialist, regime. This orientation sees the past as the realm of positive and desirable values,\nwhether it was a world of traditional sex roles or a world where the state provided jobs. It is,\ntherefore, a par excellence conservative orientation. At the same time, it is a socialist orientation as\nwell, since the past was itself socialist. Socialist conservatism correlated with socialist and left-\nwing identification and negatively with liberal identification. It was also related to high\nauthoritarianism, general dislike of outgroups, anti-Gypsy and anti-Jewish prejudice and to\nreligiosity. Individuals supporting this ideological orientation are disproportionately in favour of\nthe Munk\u00e1sp\u00e1rt, i.e., the party that represents the direct heirs of the old ruling party. It is somewhat\nironic that the socialist conservatives also disproportionately support MSZP, although this party\nhad particularly harsh monetarist policies in the government, while Socialist Conservatism is\nclearly an ideology of the economically frustrated populace.\nAnother kind of conservatism was represented by the third factor. It was primarily a\nreligion-based, or clerical conservatism. It also included a touch of nationalism and affirmative\nattitude towards the contemporary regime in Hungary. Thus, the factor was interpreted as Right-\nWing Conservatism. This label was corroborated by this factor\u2019s correlations with conservative and\nright-wing identification (positive), and with socialist identification (negative). The right-wing\nconservatism has similar socio-economic basis as its socialist counterpart. It has also similar socio-\n14",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT\nThe paper analyses cross-national survey data to explore how the legacies of communism\nmay influence political attitude differences between East and West European publics, and\nhow lasting these differences might be. It is hypothesized that communist regimes, due to\nthe sweeping, comprehensive, and ideologically justified social changes that they\nchampioned, as well as the extraordinary propaganda effort and political repression that\nthey mobilized to buttress the impact of these social changes on social values, may have\nachieved a lasting transformation of political attitudes in Eastern Europe in the direction\nof increased support for socialist economics, gender equality, and secularism. However,\nthese effects \u2013 if they ever were present at all \u2013 may have been counterbalanced, for a\nwhile, by the short-term impact of an anti-communist backlash in the early 1990s. If so,\nthen the original, intended effects of communism on values must be even more visible\naround the millenium than in the early 1990s. It is also expected that communism had\nsome unintended effects on social values: by simply suppressing free public discourse\nboth on political and more ordinary social issues, it probably led to a fossilization of\nsocial values in domains like family values, marriage and moral permissiveness, where,\nunder normal circumstances, one would have expected major value changes to take place\nin these societies simply because of the sheer amount of industrialization, urbanization\netc. that have occurred in Eastern Europe between the end of WW2 and the fall of\ncommunism. If so, then Eastern Europeans of today should have a more traditionalist\noutlook in these domains than we would expect based on their level of religiosity and\neconomic development. Such East-West value differences, however, are expected to have\ndiminished in the 1990s as free public discourse on all social issues ushered in the former\nSoviet bloc countries. The paper uses regression analyses and 1990 World Values Study\ndata, European Values Study data from 2000, and European Social Survey data from\n2002 to determine whether observed value differences between Eastern and Western\nEurope follow the patterns anticipated by the above hypotheses.\n1",

For example, the\nfirst question stated:\n\"Some politicians think that social policy cannot protect citizens from all risks,\nbut they also have to rely on themselves. For instance, all costs of medical\ntreatments should be paid either directly by everybody from his or her own\npocket, or by joining voluntary health insurance schemes individually.\nIn contrast, other politicians think that the social policy of the state must\nprotect citizens from every sort of social risks. For instance, all medical expenses\nshould be financed from the social security fund.\"\nThus, every respondent had to locate every party on the respective scales which had its\nown parliamentary party or which seemed to have (according to public opinion polls) a\nreasonable chance to gain parliamentary representation in the next election. The basic unit of\nobservation was the combination of respondents and rated parties. Thus, in the present\nanalysis, we have 500 cases in the Bulgarian data, i.e. 100 respondents rating 5 different\nconsidered simultaneously. In section one, every computation involves just one scale at a time. The weighting\nprocedure assures an equal representation of judges from each party on the issue in question. First the number of\nrespondents from party x who gave a valid answer about the position of party j on issue k was calculated: let's\ndenote this number by n (where x and j may mean the same party). To guarantee the equal representation of\nxjk\neach party j in the jury on all divisions, a weight of 20/n (where 20 is an arbitrarily selected constant) was\nxjk\nassigned to each respondent i from party x who gave a valid answer about the position of party j on issue k.

The only exceptions to this rule are environment and - on a more significant scale - urban-\nrural conflict.\nOn the amount of systematic asymmetries in judgements, overall cross-national\ndifferences seem negligible, though Poland may have somewhat fewer than the other three\ncountries. As a result, the average difference between Poland and the Czech Republic in terms\nof \"image crystallisation\" is almost as big as the average difference between the Czech\nRepublic and Hungary.\nHowever, it would be premature to conclude that Poland has the clearest party\npositions. While there is no evidence that our 14-16 issue scales represent all relevant issues\nin each of the four countries11, the precise ranking of Poland, the Czech Republic and\nHungary is at least partly a question of the weighting of economic and non-economic issues.\nIf we believe that the former should be given more weight, then probably the Czech Republic\nwould probably obey Kitschelt's (1994) hypothesis and end up with apparently less average\nrandom noise than either Poland or Hungary.

        "abstract": "Abstract\nThe content of the externalist thesis about the mind depends crucially on how we define the\ndistinction between the \"internal\" and the \"external\". According to the usual understanding, the\nboundary between the internal and the external is the skull or the skin of the subject. In this\npaper I argue that the usual understanding is inadequate, and that only the new understanding\nof the external/internal distinction I suggest helps us to understand the issue of the\ncompatibility of externalism and privileged access.\nExternalism about cognitive content has been discussed for almost forty years, and became almost\nan orthodoxy in the philosophy of mind. This orthodoxy assumes a general rough and ready\nunderstanding of the externalist thesis, without there being an unanimous agreement over its precise\nnature. Details of an exact definition perhaps do not matter for certain purposes, but they are\nimportant if we want to draw further consequences of the doctrine; for example in considering the\ncompatibility of externalism and self-knowledge. This debate has reached an almost hopelessly\nlabyrinthine state, and the reason lies, I think, partly in a certain confusion about what externalism\nis. In what follows, I shall try to clarify this issue.\n1. The boundary between the external and the internal\nA number of views have been called \"externalist\" even within the philosophy of mind. I cannot hope\nto discuss all of them here, so I shall focus my attention on what may be called \"Twin Earth\nexternalism\", the version of externalism which is expressly motivated by Twin Earth style\narguments. Twin Earth style arguments aim to establish - through the analysis of concrete examples\n- that the following is possible: that two subjects should have qualitatively identical internal states\nand yet the content of (some of) their mental states would be different because of some difference in\ntheir external environment.1 The prototype of these arguments is, of course, Putnam\u2019s argument in\n\"The Meaning of \u2018Meaning\u2019\". These arguments are used to support the thesis of externalism, which\ncan be formulated for example as follows:\n1 Some philosophers use the Twin Earth strategy to define externalism. See for example McLaughlin and Tye 1998,\n285 and in Davies 1998, 327. Jackson and Pettit draw the distinction between \"narrow\" and \"broad\" content in terms of\nthe notion of a Doppelg\u00e4nger; see Jackson and Pettit 1996, 220.\n1",
